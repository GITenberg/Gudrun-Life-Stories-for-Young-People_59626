<h2><span class="h2line1"><span class="large b i">Translator&rsquo;s Preface</span></span></h2>
<p>The charming story of &ldquo;Gudrun&rdquo; is a
romance of the old heroic period, written
by some unknown poet of Austria or
Bavaria in the thirteenth century. Next
to the &ldquo;Nibelungen Lied,&rdquo; it is the most important
of the German epic poems. Indeed some of the
person&aelig; in &ldquo;Gudrun&rdquo; are found in the &ldquo;Lied,&rdquo;
though varying in personal characteristics, probably
because they were taken from different legends.
The scenes of &ldquo;Gudrun&rdquo; are principally laid along
the shores of the North Sea and in Normandy.
The men and women in this poem resemble generally
those in the &ldquo;Lied.&rdquo; The same elemental
passions are depicted. The men are brave, vigorous
heroes, rejoicing in battle and feats of prowess;
the women are beautiful, constant, and courageous.
There are many fine delineations of character in the
original, as well as vigorous sketches of northern
scenery. The figure of Gudrun stands out in bold
relief among the maidens. There are few more
beautiful characters, indeed, in the poems of the old
heroic period, and it adds to the charm of the epic
that she does not suffer the tragic fate of Kriemhild
in the &ldquo;Nibelungen Lied,&rdquo; but that her constancy
and devotion are rewarded by her ultimate reunion
with her knightly lover, King Herwig. There are
many serious passages, but from the very first there
is the conviction that Gudrun and Herwig, in spite
of all the dangers and vicissitudes through which
they pass, will in the end be reunited. And so it
happens. Gudrun&rsquo;s name is always spoken by her
people with reverence. &ldquo;Her courage and constancy
were extolled by them, and in after days her
fame was as radiant as the stars in the heavens.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Maiden and the Princely Suitor</span></h2>
<p>There once lived in Denmark a mighty
King named Hetel, whose fame spread
far and wide. His wife Hilda bore him
two children, a son and a daughter called
Ortwin and Gudrun, who were endowed with such
surpassing strength and beauty that as they grew to
manhood and womanhood the whole country rang
with their praises. Ortwin&rsquo;s master-in-arms was
Count Wate, a hero who loved the strife and tumult
of battle better than making merry with fair dames,
and from him the young prince acquired skill in all
knightly exercises. Gudrun grew up so tall and
strong that she too could have wielded a sword with
credit had such feats been seemly for a maiden, and
when the brother and sister stood side by side, all
who beheld them declared no sculptor could have
wrought anything half so beautiful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Princes came from far and near to seek Gudrun
in marriage, but her haughty father, King Hetel,
sent them all away, some departing in sorrow,
others with bitterness and anger in their hearts.
Among those attracted by the fame of Gudrun&rsquo;s
beauty was Siegfried, King of Moreland, to whom
seven princes did homage as their lord. With
a splendid retinue he appeared at Hetel&rsquo;s court
to sue for the hand of the maiden, only to share
the fate of all her other suitors. Filled with rage
and chagrin he took his departure, vowing never
to rest till he had wrought vengeance on the proud
monarch.</p>
<p>In Normandy at this time there lived a prince
named Hartmut who no sooner heard of Gudrun
than he too was seized with the desire to make
her his wife. His mother, Queen Gerlinda, gladly
assented to his wishes, for she was an overbearing
and ambitious woman and longed to see her son
distinguished above all the other princely wooers.
But his father, King Ludwig, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we know if this Gudrun be as fair as
report paints her? Yet were she the very flower of
maidenhood, it would profit thee little, for bethink
thee how far our realm doth lie from Denmark!
Never would her parents permit their only daughter
to go so far from them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Hartmut was not to be moved from his purpose
by these remonstrances, however, and Gerlinda said:
&ldquo;Let messengers be despatched thither, and I will
bestow gold upon them, besides costly apparel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ludwig, foreboding evil, continued; &ldquo;King
Hetel and his wife Hilda are well known to me.
Haughty and overbearing are they both and &rsquo;tis like
their daughter will prove the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; replied Hartmut, &ldquo;I cannot
live if Gudrun be not mine. In truth if I may
not win her in peaceful fashion then will I go
with an army and wrest her from them by force
of arms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerlinda too urged and entreated the King, till at
last he yielded and consented to Hartmut&rsquo;s making
the attempt. &ldquo;As to an army,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is
yet time enough for that: let us first see what may
be peacefully accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Accordingly Hartmut chose sixty knights from
the noblest houses in the land, to lay his suit before
King Hetel; they set out forthwith, attired in rich
garments, their spotless armor shining in the sun,
while twelve superb sumpter horses followed, led
by retainers and laden with gold and silver. Full a
hundred days passed before they reached the borders
of Hetel&rsquo;s kingdom, where they found a warlike
people, most of them going about in helm and mail.
They asked where the King was to be found and
were shown the way to the royal castle, Hegelingen.
As they rode up to it the people came flocking
about them full of eager curiosity to gaze at the
splendid strangers, while the King ordered sumptuous
lodgings to be prepared for them.</p>
<p>On the twelfth day they were summoned before
Hetel who, seated on a shining throne and surrounded
by his vassals, received them graciously
and asked their errand. One of the knights stepped
forward and delivered to him the letter containing
King Ludwig&rsquo;s suit for his son Hartmut; but
scarcely had he learned its contents when his brow
darkened and he cried angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, by my faith! doth Ludwig dare to dishonor
my crown with such proposals? Let him
seek a Queen for his son where&rsquo;er it pleaseth him,
but approach not my throne with his presumptuous
desires!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>At these words there was a stir among the Norman
knights, and their swords seemed to rattle in their
sheaths; but they restrained themselves, and one
ventured to reply: &ldquo;Hartmut is well worthy to
be thy son-in-law, O King! for truly there is no
braver knight alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Queen Hilda, who sat beside the
King, lifted her head haughtily and said: &ldquo;Knowst
thou not that thy prince was liegeman to my father,
King Hagen, whose fame hath surely reached thine
ears? And shall the son of my father&rsquo;s vassal lead
our child homeward as his bride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith the knights were dismissed, and the
next morning they left the court. Full of hope
and impatience Hartmut looked forward to their
return, but their appearance, when at last they rode
into the courtyard, boded him little good. Reluctantly
they made known the answer of Hetel
and Hilda to his suit; whereat Ludwig foamed
with rage, and Gerlinda burst into a storm of
angry tears, but Hartmut asked one of the knights
whether the maiden was really so beautiful as it
was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth, my lord,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;so fair is she
that he who once beholds her must ever bear her
image in his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now may God chastise King Hetel for the
affront he hath dealt to me and to my house!
But for the maiden, she shall yet be mine, I
swear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words gladdened Gerlinda&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;
she cried, trembling with passion, &ldquo;may I but live
to behold her here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Contest</span></h2>
<p>Zealand, the neighboring country to
Denmark, was ruled by a young prince
named Herwig, who also came to woo
the fair Gudrun, but Hetel rejected him
as haughtily as he had rejected all the rest. Nevertheless
Herwig tarried for some months at the court,
where, from time to time, he might behold the
maiden; but although he often renewed his suit, the
King&rsquo;s answer was ever the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>One day a prince arrived at the royal castle followed
by a glittering train. He would not give
his name, and as he advanced no suit, Hetel received
him kindly and prepared a feast in his honor.
So it came to pass that he soon found an opportunity
of seeing Gudrun, and contrived to make known to
her that he was Hartmut, and had come to Denmark
for her sake alone. The maiden pitied the
gallant young hero, whose appearance pleased her
well, though she had no wish to wed him, and she
besought him to depart at once, for, should Hetel
discover who he was, he would surely slay him.
Sorrowfully Hartmut left the court. Yet he did
not abandon his purpose, but bent all his energies
toward raising an army to revenge himself upon
King Hetel.</p>
<p>Herwig was rejoiced when the splendid stranger
went upon his way, for he had feared in him a successful
rival. Again he would have renewed his own
suit; but the King sternly forbade him ever again
to speak of it, whereupon he resolved to invade the
land with an armed force to prove to the haughty
monarch that he too was a mighty prince. Accordingly,
on a dark night not long thereafter when
all within the castle of Hegelingen lay wrapped in
deepest slumber, Herwig landed with a band of
stout warriors, and at daybreak the warder on
the tower discovered the enemy close beneath the
walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;To arms!&rsquo; he thundered from the tower;</p>
<p class="t">The trump the silence broke,</p>
<p class="t0">And strident blast of larum horns</p>
<p class="t">The startled sleepers woke.</p>
<p class="t0">With flying hair the women all</p>
<p class="t">To one another clung;</p>
<p class="t0">Or flocking to the windows, there</p>
<p class="t">Their hands in terror wrung;</p>
<p class="t0">While calm in danger, knight and man</p>
<p class="t">To steed and armor sprung.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>When Hetel saw by the device on the banners
that it was Herwig who led the foe, he was secretly
pleased that the hero should thus seek to win the
maid by force of arms. This was after his own
heart, and Herwig could not have hit upon a better
plan to obtain his favor. With his wife and Gudrun
he stood at a window and watched the gallant struggle
that was in progress before the castle, expecting
to see his knights soon scatter the followers of this
fiery wooer; but great was his consternation when
he beheld Herwig gaining step by step. Wherever
the rejected suitor&rsquo;s plume waved, wherever his
flashing sword circled, there was the fray hottest,
and many of Hetel&rsquo;s stoutest warriors fell before
him. Splendid was Herwig to look upon in battle:
the helms of all who approached him were lit with
fiery sparks, while their armor was speedily adorned
with crimson bands. Even Gudrun gazed on him
with admiring eyes, terrible as the sight of the
battle was to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought Hetel, &ldquo;is Herwig worthy of my
sword&rdquo;; and donning his armor, down he strode,
only to find his men being irresistibly forced back
within the castle. Already the clash of arms re&euml;choed
from the vaulted ceiling, armor crashed
against armor in the onset. Valiantly King Hetel
dashed among his knights, but all his efforts were
powerless to check their retreat. At last the two
princes came face to face, the gray-haired hero
of a hundred battles and the young warrior bent on
winning equal fame. Blows that would have slain
many a stout champion fell thick and fast on helm
and shield, yet undismayed and unconquered fast
they stood, while sparks shot forth in fiery showers,
and links of mail fell tinkling to the stone floor.
At last Hetel stepped back a pace and said breathlessly:
&ldquo;He who does not wish me for a friend
surely is no good friend,&rdquo; and therewith rushed
once more upon the young hero; and fiercer than
ever raged the combat.</p>
<p>Terror-stricken, Gudrun watched them until at
last she could bear it no longer. Seizing a shield
she hastened down and threw herself between the
two knights, whereat Herwig lowered his sword and
gazed joyously at the stately maiden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, peace! my father, in God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; she
implored. &ldquo;Let the struggle wait until I have
asked Herwig where his dearest friend may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thou knowest well,&rdquo; cried Herwig. &ldquo;But
I will give no peace till thou dost grant me leave to
speak with thee within the castle. No evil have I
in my heart, for unarmed will I enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly at Gudrun&rsquo;s desire, the heroes laid
aside their arms and entered the castle together
in peace. Then Herwig approached Gudrun once
more to plead his suit, and Gudrun answered: &ldquo;What
maid could scorn so valiant a hero? Truly, most
noble Herwig, there is no damsel living who could
hold thee more dear than I, and if my parents do
consent, then will I gladly evermore with thee abide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Herwig besought the King and Queen for
the hand of Gudrun and they, turning to their
daughter, asked whether this betrothal would be
pleasing to her. She replied that she would choose
Herwig for her husband before all other men. So
Hetel, whose heart had been quite won by the valor
of the noble young hero, led Gudrun to him and
joined their hands together. Then all the great
lords and vassals were summoned to the hall, and in
their presence the King once more asked Gudrun
if she would have Herwig for her husband.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never could I wish for nobler lord,&rdquo; she answered.
So they were betrothed, and a great feast
was held to celebrate the joyful event.</p>
<p>When the festivities were over, Herwig wished
to take Gudrun home with him as his bride; but
Queen Hilda besought him to wait till the following
springtime, since her daughter was still so young.
In the meantime she would teach her much that it
befitted a future queen to know and she would also
have time to prepare a rich store of marriage gifts.
Herwig agreed to this though with great reluctance;
soon thereafter, bidding a sorrowful farewell to his
betrothed, he returned to his own land, little suspecting
what dire results were to follow the postponement
of the nuptials.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Siegfried&rsquo;s Revenge</span></h2>
<p>The news that Herwig had won the
heart and hand of the beautiful Gudrun
soon spread to Moreland and filled
King Siegfried, still smarting from his
own scornful rejection, with deadly hatred against
the fortunate suitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now will I kindle for thee, Sir Herwig,&rdquo; he
shouted, &ldquo;a wedding torch that shall light thy
whole land!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Forthwith he had twenty ships made ready and
filled with chosen knights. Toward the end of
May they reached the coast of Zealand, and then
began such a burning and slaying as never had been
known before. Herwig at once rode forth to meet
his fierce enemy, and a long and desperate battle
followed. Red was the soil with the blood of the
slain and bravely did Herwig and his warriors fight,
but at last they were forced to yield to superior numbers
and take refuge in a castle near by, where they
were safe for a time from the enemy. Siegfried laid
siege to it; but one of Herwig&rsquo;s knights succeeded
in stealing through the enemy&rsquo;s camp by night and,
hastening to Hegelingen, told King Hetel of the
ravages Siegfried had committed in Zealand and
of Herwig&rsquo;s dangerous situation. When Gudrun
heard these evil tidings she besought her father
to hasten to the aid of her betrothed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will I gladly do, my daughter,&rdquo; cried the
King, &ldquo;Herwig shall see &rsquo;twas not in vain I swore
faith with him, and straightway shall all our friends
be summoned hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Messengers were sent out in haste bidding his
vassals join him prepared for war without delay;
and soon a host of gallant knights assembled
with their followers all eager for battle. First
came old Wate, that dauntless champion who
never yet had known fear and of whose prowess
great tales were told. Then followed Morung,
Irolt, Horand, and the aged Frute. Had these
heroes been in the royal castle when Herwig sought
to storm it, there might well have been a different
ending to the fight! The King&rsquo;s son Ortwin also
donned his armor and begged permission to accompany
the expedition. He longed to prove his valor
for the first time and aid in avenging his sister&rsquo;s
wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Hetel at once took ship with all his forces and
soon reached Zealand. When Siegfried heard of
their coming he set forth to meet them; then there
followed a fierce conflict wherein many a good helm
and shield were shattered, but neither side could
claim a victory. With morning light the struggle
was renewed, but again the evening of the bloody
day brought no decisive result. So it went on for
twelve long days, but when on the thirteenth morning
Siegfried surveyed his dwindling forces, he knew
he might no longer venture to wage open warfare;
he retired with the remnant of his army to a strong
castle which was entirely surrounded by water. Here
at first he thought himself quite safe from Hetel&rsquo;s
swords and spears, but when he found the enemy
closely besieging his retreat he heartily wished himself
back in his own land. After sending messengers
to Hegelingen to relieve the suspense of the
Queen and Gudrun, Hetel swore a solemn oath
never to stir from that spot till Siegfried should
surrender,&mdash;a rash vow, that brought much sorrow
to him, as we shall see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Hartmut Captures Gudrun</span></h2>
<p>King Ludwig had many spies in Zealand
and word of Hetel&rsquo;s vow was soon
brought to him. He asked if the castle
held by Siegfried was a strong one, and
learning that it could well sustain a year&rsquo;s siege, he
hastened joyfully to his wife and Hartmut, saying:
&ldquo;At last the hour of our revenge is nigh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told them how Hetel with all his
bravest knights had gone to Zealand to aid Herwig,
leaving his own land but poorly guarded.
Gerlinda was overjoyed when she found the King
was bent upon avenging the affront that had been
offered her, and brought gold from her own store
to aid in arming the knights. Hartmut too was
rejoiced, and set about placing himself and his followers
in readiness with a will&mdash;though with him
it was not so much a question of revenge as of winning
the maiden he so dearly loved. At last all
was ready, and Ludwig&rsquo;s army embarked and put
out to sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>After a voyage of many days, the eager warriors
one morning spied the gleaming turrets of Matalan,
the castle occupied by Queen Hilda and her daughter,
and landing under cover of a wood succeeded
in approaching close to the walls without being seen
by the warders. Ludwig wished to begin the assault
at once, but Hartmut persuaded him to wait until
he had made one more attempt to win Gudrun by
peaceful means. For this purpose he despatched
two wealthy Counts with a message to her, but
when she learned their errand, she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say to your master I am betrothed to King
Herwig and never will I break faith with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Counts warned her that Hartmut&rsquo;s love was
so great he was ready to carry her away by force if
she would not consent to go with him of her own
will; whereat Gudrun&rsquo;s knights laughed scornfully,
so sure were they of the strength of the castle and
their own good swords, and little suspecting that an
army was concealed in the wood. The messengers
were dismissed and costly garments offered them,
with wine in gold and silver drinking-horns, but
they haughtily refused the gifts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried the Danes angrily, &ldquo;if ye do scorn
King Hetel&rsquo;s wine, then shall blood be poured for
you, forsooth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Counts rode back to Hartmut and told him
what had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that such words have been
spoken! No longer is there left me any choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battle standards were unfurled and Hartmut
advanced upon the castle with his fellows. Queen
Hilda was overjoyed when she first beheld him, for
she thought some good fortune had brought King
Hetel back. Soon, however, the device upon the
banners showed her it was Hartmut who approached,
and she ordered the gates of the castle to
be made fast. Her knights, thirsting for battle,
rushed forth; but scarcely had they met the foe when
Ludwig issued from the forest with a second force,
and dashing among the unlucky Danes, mowed
them down, as corn falls before the reapers. The
two soon forced the castle gates and planted their
victorious banners on the battlements of Matalan.
Hartmut found Gudrun in the great hall, her
cheeks pale with terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thou didst scorn me once,&rdquo; he said to her, love
and anger struggling within him, &ldquo;and for that
should I scorn to make captive any here, but rather
let all be slain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun turned away weeping and cried, &ldquo;Alas!
my father, couldst thou but know what hath befallen
thy poor child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terrible ravages were committed in the castle by
Ludwig&rsquo;s followers, which Hartmut was powerless
to prevent, though he would not suffer it to be
burned. Gudrun, with thirty of her women, was
taken captive to the ships; and after pillaging and
laying waste the country for three days, the Normans
again embarked laden with spoils; the anchors
were raised, and on the fourth morning the fleet set
sail for home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Evil Tidings</span></h2>
<p>King Hetel, who had been joined by
Herwig and his warriors, still besieged
the castle within whose walls Siegfried
defied all their assaults. One day messengers
from home arrived, and when Hetel saw
them coming he hastened joyfully to meet them,
crying, &ldquo;Tell me quickly, good sirs, how fares it
with my wife and my dear daughter Gudrun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messengers&rsquo; glances fell as one of them said
sorrowfully: &ldquo;Great is the evil that hath befallen,
my lord! Burned are thy cities, and thy castles
ruined. Full a thousand brave knights have fallen
fighting for thy house. Thy treasures hath the
enemy despoiled, and thy daughter Gudrun is taken
captive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the King laid hold of him fiercely,
saying: &ldquo;Thou speakest in frenzy, man! Who
could have done this? Speak, speak, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Ludwig of Normandy and his son
Hartmut, my lord,&rdquo; replied the messenger, &ldquo;who
suddenly appeared before Matalan with a mighty
army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King cried aloud and tore his long
gray beard in anguish. Quickly the news spread
through the camp, and the heroes Herwig and Wate,
Irolt, Frute, and Horand, hastened to his side. In
bitter grief he cried:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To you, faithful comrades, I pour out my woe!</p>
<p class="t0">On my house hath dire evil been wrought by the foe:</p>
<p class="t0">Alas! but ill-guarded we left our own shore,</p>
<p class="t0">Its gallant defenders shall guard it no more.</p>
<p class="t0">My castles are ruined, my country laid waste,</p>
<p class="t0">My liegemen lie slaughtered, my daughter disgraced;</p>
<p class="t0">In bondage, alas! must that noble maid sigh</p>
<p class="t0">Whom I to the Norman as bride did deny!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Tears streamed down Herwig&rsquo;s cheeks when he
heard these dreadful tidings, and all were moved by
the grief of the father and lover of Gudrun. Count
Wate alone remained calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take heart, my lords,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for the day
shall yet come when our sorrow will be turned to
joy again. Cease these laments, I pray, lest Siegfried
hear the sound thereof and take delight in
your affliction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Hetel strove to regain his composure and asked
mournfully what was to be done. Wate replied:
&ldquo;Now must we press Siegfried so closely on all
sides that he will gladly seize an offer of alliance
with us. This done, we shall have his aid and be
free to pursue the base marauders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This counsel cheered all the knights, and the
next morning they began such a furious assault on
the castle as Siegfried never yet had been forced to
endure. After many knights on both sides had
fallen, Irolt shouted up to the walls: &ldquo;If thou
wouldst have peace with us then ask it of King
Hetel, else shall no man of you go back alive to
his own land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Siegfried answered: &ldquo;I may not in honor sue for
peace to any man. And thinkest thou to conquer
us? &rsquo;Tis but more heroes sent to death on either
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Frute raised his voice and said: &ldquo;Swear
thou wilt ever abide by us with loyal service, and
thou mayst go hence in peace.&rdquo; And Siegfried, together
with all his knights, raised their hands and
swore it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Then the gates of the castle were thrown open,
Siegfried and Hetel clasped hands, and the rest of
the heroes did the same; so all were friends who
but a short time before had been fighting to the
death. Hetel now opened his heart to Siegfried
and told him of the calamity that had befallen them.
And Siegfried said to Herwig:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as I have hated thee, that thou didst win
the love of Gudrun, whom I too would fain have
wed, so now will I loyally aid thee to win her back
from Hartmut. Had ye not burned my ships, then
might we have pursued the Norman thieves without
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a band of pilgrims near the shore,&rdquo;
said Wate, &ldquo;with ten large ships and many smaller
vessels. These they must lend us, whether they
will or no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan was hailed with joy. Taking with him
an hundred knights, Wate forthwith brought the
ships to land, while the pilgrims, whose treasures
were safely stored on shore, were pacified with
promises of a speedy return. The next morning
Hetel, with all his companions and followers, embarked,
and a favoring wind soon bore them out
to sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Battle on the Wulpensand</span></h2>
<p>Ludwig and Hartmut meanwhile had reached
a green and thickly wooded island called
the Wulpensand, where they decided to
make a camp and rest them from their
labors for a space. Often did Gudrun gaze sadly
out across the water, the tears streaming unheeded
down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Some days had passed thus when about noon
white sails were seen upon the far horizon. Word
was brought at once to Ludwig and Hartmut, and
they hastened to the shore. Soon they distinguished
crosses on the sails and supposed them to
be pilgrim ships. But after a time, Ludwig said:
&ldquo;Yon ships do gleam and sparkle as they were filled
with shining stars&mdash;&rsquo;tis from helm and shield and
spear tip! Up, warriors! Up and arm you to
receive them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Instantly the camp was in confusion. All flew
to arms, and soon the shore was lined with shouting
warriors eager for battle. Ludwig&rsquo;s banner floated
out upon the breeze, and he shouted: &ldquo;Now, by
my faith! Our former work was but child&rsquo;s play
to what now lies before us! Stand fast, bold
knights, and richly will I reward you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer came the hostile fleet bearing
Hetel and Herwig and Siegfried with all their men,
till at last the two armies were within reach of each
other&rsquo;s spears. Then there arose such a clashing
and splintering of javelins and arrows that the noise
of the waves was completely drowned. Hastily
Hetel&rsquo;s men clambered into their boats and rowed
ashore. Wate sprang into the water up to his breast
and made his way to land, Hetel, Herwig, Ortwin,
Frute and their brave men following; and soon the
sea far out was red with blood from innumerable
wounds. Ludwig recognized Wate and hurled his
spear at the mighty champion, but he caught it fairly
on his shield and it broke, the splinters flying far
and wide. As he gained the shore, he dealt King
Ludwig a blow with his sword that sent him reeling
backward; and there with King Hetel&rsquo;s people won
to land and the fight began in earnest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Till nightfall the battle raged, when neither side
had prevailed. Then the weary heroes sought a few
hours&rsquo; repose, but at dawn the battle trumpets once
more sounded and the strife began anew. Backward
and forward rolled the tide of battle, pausing now
and then, only to burst out more fiercely than
before. At last the two Kings, Hetel and Ludwig,
met. Hetel fought like a lion robbed of its young,
and his sword whistled frightfully through the air
as the blows fell fast and furious on his adversary&rsquo;s
helm and shield. But Ludwig too was a mighty
champion, grown old in battle: at last he smote King
Hetel so powerfully that he fell dead before him.
At this a wild shout went up from the Normans,
and the news soon spread to Gudrun&rsquo;s tent, whereupon
the poor maiden with a cry of anguish sank
unconscious to the ground.</p>
<p>Wate fought like an infuriated wild beast, and
many of the enemy fell before his sword; but in
spite of all their efforts they could gain no real
advantage, and darkness fell once more without
Herwig&rsquo;s having succeeded in rescuing his bride.
Watch-fires were lit, and the two armies were so
close to each other that the gleam of their armor
could be plainly seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>That evening Ludwig took counsel with Hartmut
in his tent. He feared Wate&rsquo;s strength and deemed
it best to retire under cover of night, while the
drums and war-trumpets should sound loudly as
if in joyous anticipation of the morrow&rsquo;s conflict and
their confidence of victory, and thereby drown all
sound of preparation. This plan was forthwith
adopted; the ships were hurriedly laden and made
ready to depart, and the fair captives led thither after
having been warned as they valued their lives to
make no outcry. Ludwig&rsquo;s forces had become
so diminished that he was forced to leave many
of his ships behind for lack of men to man them.
His stratagem was successful, however; the Normans
put safely out to sea in the darkness, and a strong
breeze bore them swiftly away.</p>
<p>In the morning a dense mist enveloped land and
sea, but Wate turned to continue the battle and at
the sound of his horn the knights sprang once more
to arms. Just then the sun broke through the
clouds, and lo! the whole country stretched bare
before their bewildered gaze&mdash;the enemy had vanished!
The ground was strewn with corpses, broken
weapons, and torn banners, while near the shore
some empty ships lay tossing on the waves. At
this, such a fury of rage seized Wate that few dared
approach him. Ortwin cried: &ldquo;Let us pursue them
with all speed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>But Frute, who had been watching the wind,
replied: &ldquo;&rsquo;Twere useless now, my lord. Full
thirty miles have they the start of us, nor with our
remnant of an army may we venture a pursuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will we take vengeance on the living
through the dead!&rdquo; shouted grim Irolt. &ldquo;Unburied
shall they lie to feed the ravens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Herwig reproved him, saying: &ldquo;Nay, comrade,
that must never be! Rather let us dig ample
graves and bury friend and foe together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Dead foes no longer hatred claim;</p>
<p class="t0">Grudge not the dead true hero&rsquo;s fame!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This was done, and after all the slain had been
consigned to earth, with heavy hearts the heroes
once more embarked and set sail for home.</p>
<p>Soon Queen Hilda&rsquo;s castle rose before them from
the sea, whereat groans of anguish burst from many
a mail-clad breast. Ortwin cried: &ldquo;Alas! how can
I appear before my mother? Not only have we
failed to deliver Gudrun, but now my father lies
beneath the stones of Wulpensand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Herwig too shrank from breaking the evil tidings
to Queen Hilda, nor were any of their comrades
willing to undertake the task. But when they had
reached the shore Wate gruffly said: &ldquo;It is useless
to attempt to conceal the truth from the Queen,&rdquo;
and himself rode to the castle, looking so grim and
forbidding that all who beheld him shrank in terror.
But Hilda, who had seen him coming and had also
marked the sadly diminished fleet upon the strand,
hastened anxiously to meet him and asked him in
trembling accents for her lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not deceive thee, lady,&rdquo; said the hero,
his rough features clouded with grief; &ldquo;the King
is slain, and with him the greater part of our comrades&rdquo;;
and therewith he told her of the battle
on the island.</p>
<p>Quickly the news spread, and from the castle
arose loud wailing and sounds of woe, to which
all the heroes added their lamentations. The
whole court was plunged into grief, and Wate
alone retained his firmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace&mdash;peace&mdash;my friends! No plaints nor
sighs will ever open the King&rsquo;s grave or bring back
Gudrun to us. With the handful of warriors that
are left us, we can do nothing now, &rsquo;tis true, but
ere-long a younger generation will be of age to bear
arms, and then our day of reckoning will come!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Gudrun&rsquo;s Danger</span></h2>
<p>As Ludwig&rsquo;s fleet drew near the coast of
Normandy the gleaming turrets of his
royal castle shone out across the green
water; far into the distance stretched
fruitful fields and wooded heights, bathed in
bright sunlight. Then the King led his captive
to the ship&rsquo;s deck, her trembling companions following,
and said kindly to her, &ldquo;Maiden, behold
the land of which thou art one day to be
Queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hartmut fixed his ardent gaze upon the fair
prisoner, hoping she would at last look with favor
on him, but Gudrun answered firmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather would I choose death than wed with
Hartmut! &rsquo;Twas he who brought all this sorrow
upon me through his invasion of our kingdom, and
but for him my noble father who now on yonder
island sleeps in his grave, had been yet alive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>This enraged the King; but controlling himself,
he told her she must reconcile herself to what had
happened, since it could not now be altered, and
she must choose between royal honors and a
shameful captivity.</p>
<p>Undauntedly the maiden replied: &ldquo;I have sworn
faith with Herwig, and death alone shall free me
from my troth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had she uttered the words when the
fierce Norman King seized her by the hair and
flung her into the sea. Hartmut sprang forward
to save his beloved, but in vain. For a moment
her fair hair floated on the water, then he plunged
after her and both disappeared below the surface.
Anxiously those on the ship gazed downward, fearing
that the King&rsquo;s son, too, would find a watery
grave. Soon he rose again, however, supporting
the maiden on his strong arm; and the ship&rsquo;s folk,
who had already sprung into a boat, drew both to
safety.</p>
<p>Hartmut gave Gudrun into the hands of her
women, ordering them to take her below and provide
her with dry garments without delay. Then
confronting his father with glowing cheeks, he demanded
sternly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore wouldst thou have drowned her who
is more dear to me than life itself? By my faith,
had another dared what thou hast done, I would
have paid him with my sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angrily the King answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, speak not thus to me! I am grown old
in honors, and honor will I have from thee till I
am dead. Therefore warn Gudrun that she heed
her words in future when she hath speech with
me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Reception</span></h2>
<p>Soon the fleet reached the shore, and Hartmut
sent messengers to his mother to bid
her prepare to receive Gudrun as became
her rank. Gerlinda was overjoyed when she
learned that the daughter of that haughty monarch
who had once offered her such an affront was with
the Normans on the ships, and ordered the costliest
apparel to be made ready, though rather, it must
be said, to display her own riches than to fulfil the
wishes of her son.</p>
<p>Now Hartmut had a sister named Ortrun, who
rejoiced in the thought that Gudrun would be a
beloved sister to her, and joyfully assisted in all the
preparations for the festivities. Three days were
thus occupied, and on the fourth morning a splendid
procession wended its way down from the royal
castle to the shore. Gerlinda and Ortrun came
first, mounted on white palfreys and arrayed in
magnificent robes of silk interwoven with gold,
while behind them rode a glittering train of knights,
all sumptuously attired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Joyous strains of music penetrated to the ships,
but they fell on Gudrun&rsquo;s ear like the harsh cry of
the screech-owl. Soon she with her maidens was
conducted to the land.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The broken-hearted royal maid</p>
<p class="t">With tottering steps was seen&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Shrinking from Hartmut&rsquo;s proffered aid&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Approach the haughty Queen.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ortrun, impatient, longed to make</p>
<p class="t">Her loving welcome known,</p>
<p class="t0">For to her seemed this stranger maid</p>
<p class="t">Like sister all her own.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But as she joyously draws nigh,</p>
<p class="t">With sinking heart she sees</p>
<p class="t0">In Gudrun&rsquo;s eyes the bitter tears&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Then all her rapture flees.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">They closely clasp each other&rsquo;s hand&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">A kiss&mdash;and then they part:</p>
<p class="t0">No words they speak, but in their eyes</p>
<p class="t">Each reads the other&rsquo;s heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then Queen Gerlinda turned to her</p>
<p class="t">With falsely flattering look</p>
<p class="t0">And would have sought a greeting kiss&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">This Gudrun would not brook.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Approach me not!&rdquo; she proudly said,</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Thou cause of all my woe!</p>
<p class="t0">For me to suffer thy embrace</p>
<p class="t">Were worse than crime, I trow!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Gerlinda seemed not to hear these words, but
her heart swelled within her with rage. Tents were
now pitched on the green sunny meadow, and
Hartmut spared no pains to please and cheer Gudrun
with music and tilting, but her tears flowed unceasingly,
nor could all his efforts avail to comfort
her. She sat with her head on Ortrun&rsquo;s shoulder,
and Ortrun wept with her.</p>
<p>Moved by her sorrow, Hartmut put an end to
the games and gave the signal for departure. At
the castle Gudrun found sumptuous apartments
prepared for her and her maidens, but she felt as if
she were entering a tomb; in truth, it would have
been a welcome thought to her could she have felt
that never again should she awake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Gudrun&rsquo;s Test</span></h2>
<p>Many months passed during which Hartmut
omitted no proof of devotion to his
fair captive, but never did the King&rsquo;s
daughter cease to think of him whose
ring of gold she wore upon her finger.</p>
<p>One day Gerlinda said to Gudrun in the presence
of her son: &ldquo;When wilt thou relent, perverse
one? Delay no longer, but give thy hand to
Hartmut, for, of a truth, he is the peer of any
king alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer Gudrun turned toward her and asked:
&ldquo;Wouldst thou, Lady Gerlinda, take for thy husband
one who had caused the death of so many of
thine own people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerlinda, knowing how her son&rsquo;s heart was set
on Gudrun, replied: &ldquo;Nay, dwell not on what is
past, thou foolish maid! Wed him who loves
thee well, and gladly will I yield to thee my
crown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Gudrun&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears and her cheeks
grew red, as she answered:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Can there be love where treacherous deeds</p>
<p class="t0">Of bloody crimes have sown the seeds?</p>
<p class="t0">The bitter tears mine eyes so drown,</p>
<p class="t0">They dim the glitter of a crown.</p>
<p class="t0">For freedom thirsts my soul for aye,</p>
<p class="t0">Of freedom dream I night and day:</p>
<p class="t0">Naught but a captive I&rsquo;ll remain,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor wed him whom my sire hath slain!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She left the hall weeping.</p>
<p>Hartmut sprang up angrily, saying: &ldquo;Enough
of this! Since she ever doth scorn me, I will no
longer show her favor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This filled Gerlinda with secret joy, for now at
least she thought the haughty princess would be in
her power, and following Hartmut she said to
him: &ldquo;My son, &rsquo;tis beyond thy skill to deal with
Gudrun. So stubborn a child can be brought to
better ways only by those of more experience.
Leave her to me and thou shalt soon find her pride
humbled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven grant it!&rdquo; cried Hartmut. &ldquo;Easily
might I force her to be mine, yet my heart rebels
against such harshness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me,&mdash;all shall be as thou dost wish,&rdquo;
replied Gerlinda, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fail not to deal with her as becomes her rank,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;and forget not that the poor maid
hath had much cause for grief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Hartmut took leave of his
parents and left the court, but ere he departed he
sought his mother once more and charged her to
treat Gudrun kindly. Then he rode forth with
his followers to drown remembrance of his love and
sorrow in the dangers of battle, bearing with him
the hope that Gudrun&rsquo;s heart would turn to him at
last. Had he but known the evil thoughts in
Gerlinda&rsquo;s mind, he would never have departed.
Scarcely was he out of sight, however, when the
Queen gave full vent to her malice. Seeking Gudrun,
she said to her: &ldquo;Since thou dost scorn the
love and favor of a King, forsooth, thou shalt do
menial service and taste beggar&rsquo;s fare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied Gudrun, &ldquo;I am at thy mercy
and must bear whate&rsquo;er thou dost inflict on me.
But know this, Queen! that naught shall avail to
shake my loyalty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Gerlinda, &ldquo;shall thy maidens
also serve as drudges for the sake of thy loyalty:
heat the ovens, carry wood, and sweep up dust and
litter. Oh, I will soon bend thy stubborn pride,
I promise thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun was greatly distressed that her maidens,
who were all of noble birth, should be made to
suffer for her sake, but she was powerless to prevent
it.</p>
<p>What the Queen had threatened soon came to
pass. Gudrun was separated from her companions
and forced to perform the lowest tasks, but when
Gerlinda one day asked her mockingly how her life
at the court now pleased her, she replied simply:
&ldquo;The good God who gave me constancy, granted
me also the strength to bear the undeserved trouble
it hath brought upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus three years went by, and Hartmut returned
at last from his wanderings, rich in fame and honors.
Full of hope, he rode joyfully into the castle; but
what was his horror to behold the high-born princess
in the garb of a menial!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! my mother, what hast thou done?&rdquo; he
cried, and giving his hand to Gudrun, he said
sorrowfully: &ldquo;Believe me, most noble maiden, &rsquo;tis
through no fault of mine that this shame hath befallen
thee! Yet wilt thou but look upon my suit
with favor, then all thy sorrow shall be turned to
joy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>But Gudrun answered: &ldquo;Already have I made
it plain to thee that my heart is his to whom my
vows are plighted. Go! leave me to the misery
thine honor should have spared me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hartmut reminded her of his rescue of her
from the water at peril of his life, as proof of his
devotion. &ldquo;And wilt thou leave such love still
unrewarded?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it not thou,&rdquo; replied Gudrun, &ldquo;that tore
me from my home and all I loved? Didst thou not
slay my father? And yet for all these wrongs thou
dost expect my thanks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it as thou wilt, then!&rdquo; he cried angrily,
&ldquo;and abide in thy misery! &rsquo;Twas no act of mine
that brought it upon thee, yet it well-nigh seems
thou dost deserve thy shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not long till his love for Gudrun again
awoke, and he determined to make one more effort
to win her heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ortrun</span></h2>
<p>Hartmut now went to his sister and
said: &ldquo;I pray thee, comfort Gudrun and
be a sister to her, so many bitter griefs
hath she been forced to bear. Seek, too,
to turn her heart toward me by kindness. Canst
thou but do this, my sister, then will I owe thee
thanks so long as I do live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ortrun wept for joy at these words, and embracing
her brother fondly, replied: &ldquo;Happy indeed shall I
be once more to see thy love. Our mother forbade
me to approach her, and great grief was this to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said Hartmut: &ldquo;Henceforth thou shalt
share all thy joys with her, dear Ortrun. Perchance
if we make her happy here with us her heart may
yet be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Joyfully Ortrun hastened to Gudrun and besought
her love and friendship, telling her the good news
that hereafter by Hartmut&rsquo;s desire they were to share
the same chamber; and the two royal maidens
acknowledged they had missed and longed for one
another.</p>
<p>Happier days dawned for Gudrun. She spent all
her time with Ortrun, whose only thought was to
cheer her sorrowful companion. When Gudrun
talked of her home and people, she listened with
loving interest or shared her tears. She would
gladly have welcomed the Danish princess as her
sister-in-law and lost no opportunity to speak good
of Hartmut, whom she dearly loved. But as time
went on, she saw more and more clearly that her
friend&rsquo;s constancy was unalterable; and it troubled
her greatly, for she foresaw more evil days for
Gudrun. So the Winter passed, and the Summer,
and another Winter drew nigh.</p>
<p>Then Gerlinda persuaded her son to ask Gudrun
for the last time to share his throne. So he went to
her and besought her once more to be his Queen.
Again she refused; whereat Hartmut asked her if he
was not as worthy of her love as Herwig, but she
only said: &ldquo;Herwig hath my promise, and I will
not break it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Hartmut assured her that Herwig must have
already broken faith with her, since for all these
years he had allowed his sword to rust in its sheath
and had made no effort to rescue her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth I know not why this should be,&rdquo; she
answered; &ldquo;yet even if he hath forgotten me, still
will I be true to him till death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Hartmut went back to Gerlinda and said:
&ldquo;Naught will alter the maiden&rsquo;s resolution. I can do
no more; wherefore take her and deal with her as
thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he warned his knights to be on their guard.
&ldquo;For if the friends and kindred of Gudrun be as
steadfast as she hath proved herself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it yet
may chance an army shall invade our land.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Gudrun&rsquo;s Trials</span></h2>
<p>From that day fresh hardships fell to the
lot of the King&rsquo;s daughter; yet when the
enraged Queen ordered her to return once
more to her drudgery, saying it was only
pride that caused her to refuse Hartmut&rsquo;s hand,
Gudrun answered quietly: &ldquo;God knows my heart,
and if it be His will that I should suffer thus, it is
not for me to rebel, but to do all thou dost require
of me, so that it touch not the faith I have sworn
with Herwig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the Queen replied: &ldquo;Then shall it be
thy daily task to wash garments, and take heed that
thou art not found idle a single hour from early
morn till nightfall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this the maiden was forced to do, though she
knew nothing of such work; nor did Gerlinda fail
to greet her with taunts and jeers whenever she saw
her. But Hartmut went about silently, with never
a friendly word to any man, for his heart was sore
within him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>So diligently did Gudrun apply herself to her
task, however, that soon it would have been hard to
find a more skilful washerwoman than the high-born
maiden, but her companions&rsquo; hearts were well-nigh
broken when they saw the heavy labor their beloved
mistress was compelled to perform. One of them,
indeed, named Heregart, proved disloyal to her and
wedded a Norman duke, the King&rsquo;s cup-bearer,
whereby she found favor at court, and all went well
with her, but the rest of the damsels, like Gudrun,
remained true to their own land and to one another
through all their trials and sufferings. One of them,
the Princess Hildburg, was so grieved at Gudrun&rsquo;s
hard lot, and wept and lamented so bitterly over it,
that Gerlinda at last observed it and maliciously said
to her: &ldquo;Since thou takest Gudrun&rsquo;s fate so much to
heart, go thou and take her place when she is weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly would I bear all her burdens, if such
might be!&rdquo; replied Hildburg. &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name,
madame, put not the maiden to such shame! Remember
that her father wore a crown. Yet I, who
am also a prince&rsquo;s child, would rejoice if I might
only share her lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, by my faith, that shalt thou surely do, in
payment for thy bold words, thou malapert!&rdquo; cried
Gerlinda, furiously. &ldquo;Through the snow shalt
thou go with Gudrun daily to the shore, and I will
see to it thou hast work enough to weary thee, I
warrant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerlinda little knew that instead of inflicting a
heavy punishment upon the loyal maiden, she had
made her happier than she had been for many a day.
Scarcely could she wait for evening to come, and
when at last she spied Gudrun wearily returning
from her day&rsquo;s labor, she ran to meet her and they
wept in one another&rsquo;s arms. Then Hildburg said,
&ldquo;I have persuaded that monster to let me go with
thee to the shore and share thy toil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God reward thy loyalty, dear Hildburg!&rdquo;
cried Gudrun, embracing her once more, &ldquo;if I but
have thee to talk with while I am at my work, the
hours will seem short indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next morning, and thereafter, they went together
with their baskets to the shore, and though
the work was hard and painful, their love for each
other sustained them and enabled them to endure
their sufferings patiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">On the Wulpensand</span></h2>
<p>All this time Gudrun&rsquo;s mother, Queen
Hilda, as well as her lover, brother, and
all her friends, supposed that Hartmut
had forced her to become his wife; but
none the less were they firmly resolved to avenge
the outrage and bring her home again. With this
in view the Queen had seven large strong vessels
built, and two and twenty smaller ships; a vast
store of armor and weapons was also made ready,
and at last one day she summoned old Irolt to the
castle and told him it was her wish to erect a cloister
on the Wulpensand in honor of her dead husband,
and after this was done, her loyal subjects should
undertake the voyage to Normandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day of retribution is in truth at hand, O
Queen!&rdquo; replied Irolt, &ldquo;for a brave and stalwart
generation hath grown to manhood; methinks
&rsquo;twere well to summon forthwith thy friends from
far and near.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The Queen was rejoiced and hastened to send
messengers first of all to Herwig of Zealand, who
welcomed them gladly, for he surmised their errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble Herwig,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;the time has
come to avenge Queen Hilda&rsquo;s wrong, and in this
she counts upon thy aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor have I forgotten Gudrun, who was pledged
to me in solemn troth and whom Hartmut, in defiance
of all right and custom hath held captive all
these years. Say to thy Queen I will join her
speedily with my knights, and that never yet was
war so welcome to my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the messengers bore the news to the Queen&rsquo;s
other friends and allies, to Horant, Morung, Frute,
and Wate, and all promised to be ready. When
Hilda heard this she sent for her son Ortwin, who
long had yearned for this day to come. He was in
the forest hawking when the messengers arrived,
and rode eagerly to meet them. They soon made
known to him what had passed, whereupon he
snatched the hood from the falcon&rsquo;s head and let it
go free, for now, thought he, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a question of that
higher game, for which I have longed so often.&rdquo;
Joyfully he hurried to his mother and sent out
word to his followers to assemble with all haste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Swift messengers the tidings bore</p>
<p class="t">With speed throughout the land;</p>
<p class="t0">Ended were now the sounds of woe,</p>

<p class="t0">The battle steeds were panoplied,</p>
<p class="t">The flags their folds outflung,</p>
<p class="t0">While all along the western shore,</p>
<p class="t">Forests of masts upsprung.</p>
</div>
<p>At last all the preparations were complete, and
the heroes sought Queen Hilda and prayed her for
leave to depart on their journey. Invoking God&rsquo;s
blessing upon them she bade them farewell, and,
after a last tearful embrace of her son, turned to
them, saying: &ldquo;Watch over him faithfully, my
loyal friends! Brave and valiant I well know him to
be; yet he is but young and inexperienced in warfare.
Keep ever at his side, therefore, should he
press forward too boldly in the tumult of battle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The heroes boarded the ships, already laden with
their arms and stores, while a great throng of people
gathered on the shore to watch their departure.
The anchors were weighed, the white sails shaken
out, and, aided by a favoring gale, the fleet put out
to sea. Women waved farewells to their departing
husbands; from the ships arose the sound of
trumpet and drum, while the heroes lustily chanted
a war song as out they sailed farther and farther
into the shining sea. Wate took the lead and
steered the fleet for the Wulpensand. After a
voyage of several days the green island appeared
before them; but before they could reach it a great
storm arose. Mountainous waves came rushing
down upon them, the ribs of the ships creaked and
groaned, and the tall masts bent under the fury of
the gale. Dark as night it grew, while red lightning
flashes darted from the inky clouds and seemed
to strike the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Horant. &ldquo;Dost hear that sound
of wailing? Methinks King Hetel finds no rest in
his unconsecrated grave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>These words fired Ortwin with desire to carry
peace to his father&rsquo;s soul, and tearing a cross from
the mast he leaped with it into the boiling flood
which closed angrily over him. His comrades gave
him up for lost, but soon, by the glare of the lightning,
they saw him rise to the surface, and parting
the waves with strong arms, he succeeded, by God&rsquo;s
mercy, in gaining the shore of the Wulpensand.
There he planted the cross upon the mound that
marked the warrior&rsquo;s place of burial, and knelt in
prayer beside it. As the vivid flashes revealed the
noble form of the beautiful youth to those upon
the ship, he seemed like a heavenly vision, bathed
in the fiery glow. The sight restored the sinking
courage of many a knight, and with new strength
they bent to the work of battling with the waves.
Soon the thunder lessened, the wind died away, and,
as the golden sunlight broke again from out the
clouds, their vessels reached the shore in safety.</p>
<p>For many days the heroes remained on the island
praying for the souls of the departed, for few were
there in all the host who had not some kin or friend
to mourn among the slain. The thought of these
served to steel their courage, and as Siegfried, who
had been reminded of his oath, had by this time
joined them with a large number of ships and men,
the whole fleet put out again to sea.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Tale of Hagen and the Griffin</span></h2>
<p>The way was far to Normandy, and time
often hung heavily on the hands of the
heroes, who were longing for action.
Sometimes, when the wind failed, a number
of them would assemble on the deck, while
gray-bearded warriors related many an adventure of
their own or their forefathers&rsquo;. Thus it chanced one
day that several of the younger knights gathered
about Frute and besought him to tell them the tale
of Hagen and the Griffin. Frute agreed, and, seating
himself upon a pile of armor, leaned back against
the mast while his hearers formed a circle about
him on the deck. The sun was setting and its
ruddy gleams were reflected from the mirror-like
surface of the water upon the face of the aged hero,
as he began:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time there ruled in Ireland a King
called Sigeband, whose wife bore him a son. He
was named Hagen, and while yet a child all who
saw him marvelled at his strength. By the time he
had reached his seventh year he refused to remain
any longer in the women&rsquo;s care, but desired only to
be with men and learn to wield arms. Sigeband encouraged
his son&rsquo;s wishes, and the boy soon became
so skilled in the use of spear and sword that even
the oldest warriors were amazed and declared that
never before had such a child been seen. Now it
chanced that the Queen one day was sitting upon
the battlements of the castle gazing sorrowfully out
before her, when the King appeared and asked the
cause of her sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear lord!&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;rich indeed are we
in lands and subjects, as also in fame and honor, yet
one thing do we lack that oft doth grieve me much.
At my dear father&rsquo;s court many knights of great renown
came and went, and there were daily feastings
and tourneys, the fame of which spread throughout
all lands. But here, alas! we heap up vast
stores of gold and jewels in our treasure chests,
and forswear those pleasures which might well
serve in time of need to provide us with blood and
treasure.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou speakest truth, my wife,&rsquo; said the King,
&lsquo;and henceforth I will do even as other princes.
To-morrow messengers shall summon hither all our
friends from far and near, and we will prepare a
great feast for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this Queen Ute was rejoiced and cried joyfully:
&lsquo;Then I will search my chests and bring
forth rich garments with gold and jewels also,
that we may fittingly reward the victors in the
games.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spring came and with it the time fixed for the
festivities. The fields were gay with blossoms, and
wood and grove were filled with the songs of birds.
On every road were seen fluttering pennons as bands
of knights in shining armor approached from all directions.
The huge castle with its sixty towers was
soon filled to overflowing, and sumptuous tents were
erected without the walls, while the King and Queen
took good care that their guests were well provided
for in every way. Sounds of mirth and rejoicing
filled the air, and many a lance was splintered in
the lists. Thus nine days went joyously by, but
on the tenth a terrible calamity befell the royal
host.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the hall a wandering minstrel had just struck
his harp and begun his heroic lay. King Sigeband
and his Queen were seated on the throne, with
knights and ladies grouped about them in a circle.
The little prince was in the garden with his attendants
who, attracted by the minstrel&rsquo;s song, had gathered
about the door, forgetting the child; and he
ran gayly hither and thither, rejoicing in his freedom.
Suddenly there was a great crashing among
the branches of the trees, and a griffin swooped
down, seized the boy in its claws and bore him
off with mighty strokes of its huge wings. His
screams penetrated to the hall, and all rushed
forth in alarm; but rescue was then impossible,
for already the griffin had mounted to the clouds
and soon vanished in the distance with its prey.
There was an end of all the festivities, and naught
but lamentations and cries of woe were heard
throughout the castle, where but now had echoed
the sound of joyous laughter. The royal parents
were well-nigh broken-hearted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;The boy still lived, however, and gazed, terror-stricken,
into the depths beneath him. Faster than
the storm-wind flew the griffin and soon the sea was
beneath them. Full a hundred miles from home
had he been borne, when looking down Hagen
perceived a dark chain of rugged mountains rising
from an island. Here the griffin alighted on a rocky
peak, flung the boy into its nest and flew away again.
The young griffins stretched their necks eagerly
for the prey, the flapping of their wings sounding
like the breakers on the shore, but each tried to
seize the prize for himself and began to fight, clawing
fiercely at one another with harsh cries. One of
the monsters, profiting by this opportunity, seized
the boy and flew with him to the top of a tree,
but as it alighted the branch broke beneath the
creature&rsquo;s weight, and Hagen, slipping from its
clutches, dropped safe to the ground and hastily
concealed himself in a cleft of rock thickly overgrown
with bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the young hero had recovered somewhat
from his fright he looked about him and, seeing
no sign of the griffin, was creeping cautiously along
through the bushes, when suddenly there stood before
him three beautiful damsels. They too had
been stolen in their childhood by the griffin; but
how they had contrived to escape the monster is
no part of my tale. When they saw the noble boy
in his rich garments coming toward them they were
terrified, and quickly disappeared in a rocky cave
near by, thinking that a dwarf who dwelt in the
heart of the mountains had come forth into the
light of day. But no sooner did Hagen spy
the maidens than he sprang eagerly after them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whence comest thou?&rsquo; they cried. &lsquo;Get
thee hence and do us no evil, for enough have
we to bear already!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, dear maidens, send me not away, I pray,&rsquo;
replied Hagen, &lsquo;but give me something to eat, for
I am well-nigh famished. A fierce griffin brought
me hither. Only help me and I will tell you whence
I came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they saw that it was really a human child
before them, they were overjoyed and caressed the
boy fondly, after which they brought him food and
drink and made him welcome to their cave. There
he abode with them many days and years, and grew
strong and brave under their loving care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day a band of pilgrims chanced to approach
the island in their ships, and Hagen and the maidens
gazed joyfully at them, for they thought the hour
of their deliverance had come. But suddenly a
great storm arose; lightning flashed from the inky
clouds, and loud rolled the thunder. The ships
were tossed hither and thither among the raging
billows. One after another was dashed to pieces
on the rocks in spite of all the efforts of the
unfortunate pilgrims; and when the storm subsided
no soul was left alive of all the band. The next
morning the shore was strewn with corpses, and
the griffin bore many of them to its nest to feed
its young.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hagen spied the body of a knight among them
who had been dashed against a rock by the force of
the waves. Watching his chance, the youth hurriedly
seized the knight&rsquo;s mail and helm and sword
and bow and quiver. Scarcely had he completed
his task when he heard a whiffling among the rocks
and saw the griffin approaching; but now he was
well armed and had no thought of fear. With
steady hand he launched an arrow at the creature,
but it rebounded from the thick hide and
fell harmless to the ground. Therewith the furious
monster rushed upon him; but already the
sword flashed above Hagen&rsquo;s head, and springing
aside he shore off one of the huge wings. Then it
struck fiercely at him with its claw, but this too he
severed at a blow, and soon his foe lay dead before
him. A cry of joy issued from the cave; but
scarcely was it uttered when a fresh terror seized
the maidens, for now a whole swarm of griffins
came swooping down from the rocks. But Hagen&rsquo;s
courage had grown with victory, and the sword
gleamed like lightning in his hands. Fierce indeed
was the struggle and many a hero would
have succumbed, but the youth held his ground
bravely and succeeded at last in slaying all the
monsters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then he cried: &lsquo;Come forth, dear maidens!
Now for the first time you may enjoy the sun and
air in freedom, without fear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joyously they ran to greet the gallant youth&mdash;nor
could they sufficiently thank him for slaying
the terrible griffins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new life began for Hagen. From that hour
he had no thought save for the use of his new-found
weapons; nor was it long till he could bring down
birds upon the wing with his arrows. Even fishes
in the water could not escape his skill. He would
spend whole days roaming about through the forest;
learned to run swiftly as the flying stag, and, to the
amazement and terror of the maidens, would leap
streams and chasms with the strength and agility
of the panther.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once a fierce dragon sprang at him from a dark
cleft of rock; but Hagen clove its skull with his
sharp sword, and it fell, writhing horribly in the
death agony. When it was dead he tasted the blood
of the creature, and immediately felt new strength
come to him; whereupon he drank of it till he
had gained the strength of twelve men. The skin
he bore with him to the cave as a trophy of his
victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long after this he met a lion in the forest,
but at the sound of his mighty hunting call the beast
turned and fled. Hagen pursued and captured it
alive and, after binding up its jaws and claws with
ropes of fibre, bore his prize to the maidens on his
shoulders. Before this they had been unable to
make fires and were forced to eat raw meat, but now
Hagen could strike sparks from the rocks, and this
proved of great help to the maidens. The food
they were now able to prepare was more wholesome
and palatable, and day by day their beauty grew to
greater fulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day Hagen said: &lsquo;Let us follow the shore
of the island; perchance elsewhere we may discover
a ship that will take us to our homes.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;They set out upon their quest without delay, the
maidens clad in garments they had skilfully wrought
from fibre, and after twenty-five days of wandering
they descried a vessel. Hagen&rsquo;s voice was louder
than the roaring of the waves, and his shouts were
soon heard by those on the ship; but when they
beheld the strangely clad damsels, they took them
for water-nixies and dared not row a boat to land.
Then Hagen called on them for help in God&rsquo;s
name; whereupon the count who commanded the
vessel entered a boat with twelve knights and came
ashore. He was struck with the wondrous beauty
of the maidens, but they were ashamed of their rude
attire and hastily concealed themselves. Some of
the knights rowed back to the ship and fetched
some women&rsquo;s apparel, which the girls hastily
donned in the shelter of a thicket, after which the
count took them with Hagen on his vessel. The
ship&rsquo;s folk greeted the maidens kindly when they
found they were not tricksy sprites but fair mortals;
and after they had refreshed themselves with food
and drink, the count asked what evil fate had
brought them to the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were loath to make their misfortunes known
to a stranger, yet could not well refuse the request.
Accordingly, the eldest replied: &lsquo;My father wore
the crown of farthest India, when the griffin snatched
me from him. Alas! I shall nevermore behold
my home!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I too am from a distant land,&rsquo; said the second
maiden. &lsquo;My noble father&mdash;plunged in deepest
sorrow by my loss, I fear&mdash;was King of Portugal,
and many princes did homage to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lastly, the youngest spoke: &lsquo;My home is in
Iceland, whence the griffin bore me hither. So dear
am I unto my father that well I know he gladly
would bestow his crown on him who may restore
me to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas by God&rsquo;s will that ye were carried to
the island,&rsquo; said the count, &lsquo;and surely He hath
wrought your deliverance. Trust yourselves therefore
to His care!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he turned to Hagen, saying: &lsquo;Thy companions
have made known to me their rank and
history; now would I gladly learn thine own, bold
youth, and how thou camest to the island.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My fate was even as theirs, Sir Knight,&rsquo; replied
Hagen; &lsquo;like them I was borne hither by the
griffin. As for my father, he is King of Ireland,
Sigeband by name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the count asked whether the monster yet
lived. Hagen&rsquo;s eyes flashed and he grasped his
sword firmly as he answered: &lsquo;Nay, I slew the
creature and therewith all its young.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;All eyes were fixed in amazement upon the young
hero as he spoke these words, and some of the
knights praised him, saying: &lsquo;Truly, thy deed
is worthy all men&rsquo;s praise; indeed &rsquo;twere doubtful
whether any of us would have succeeded in slaying
the griffin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Hagen observed how they talked with one
another apart and endeavored secretly to remove
his weapons. This roused his anger, and he warned
them against any misdeed; whereupon the count
whispered to his followers: &lsquo;We must accomplish
our ends by force!&rsquo; Then approaching Hagen, he
said harshly: &lsquo;Of a truth, thou hast fallen into
my hands in good time. Much injury have I suffered
from thy father&rsquo;s warriors&mdash;wherefore I will
hold thee captive till such time as he shall have
made me full amends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whatsoever evil may have befallen thee at the
hands of Ireland&rsquo;s heroes, that surely is no fault
of mine,&rsquo; replied Hagen. &lsquo;Yet do thou but fetch
me to my home and all shall be well, I promise
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Better security is it for me to hold thee prisoner,&rsquo;
said the count. &lsquo;As for the maidens, I will bestow
them upon my courtiers.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;At these words Hagen flew into a passion.
&lsquo;Now, by my faith,&rsquo; he shouted, &lsquo;I will not be
thy captive, nor shalt thou touch one hair upon the
maidens&rsquo; heads!&rsquo; Then turning to the ship&rsquo;s
people, he cried&mdash;&lsquo;Richly will I reward you, good
mariners, if ye will hearken to my bidding and bear
me to my home. Heed well my words, for if ye
do fail me, good cause shall ye have to rue it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the count sternly ordered them to seize
Hagen, whereupon the youth snatched his sword
from its sheath, and a furious fight began upon the
ship. Heads rolled from the deck into the sea, and
Hagen thrust the bodies after them with his foot.
None could stand against him, and at last all those
who were not slain fled to the farthest corner of the
ship&rsquo;s hold. Then he rushed upon the count, who
would surely have been slain had not the maidens
besought Hagen to have mercy. At their prayers,
the hero sheathed his sword and ordered the ship
to be steered according to his will. None dared
now to oppose him, and thus the homeward voyage
to Ireland was begun. Nor did the ship&rsquo;s folk
need word or deed from this time forth to urge
them to industry, for they already feared his very
glance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the seventeenth day they came in sight
of the castle where Hagen&rsquo;s parents dwelt, and the
mariners were in great fear lest Sigeband should slay
them; but when Hagen saw this he reassured them,
saying: &lsquo;Fear not! My father will forgive all
when he learns &rsquo;twas ye that did save me from the
island. Some of you shall bear a message to my
parents to tell them I still do live, and surely no evil
will befall those who bring such tidings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choosing twelve men, therefore, he said to them:
&lsquo;Go ye to the court and ask the King if he would
behold his son. He will not credit your words,
perchance. Seek then my mother and ask her if she
doth bear in mind the golden cross her son was
used to wear upon his breast. She will surely
follow you to the ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men did as they were bidden; but when
they entered the royal hall, the King at once recognized
them by their garments as his foes and
angrily demanded how they had dared come thither.
Whereupon one of them replied: &lsquo;My Lord, thy
son Hagen hath sent us. Soon shalt thou behold
him, for he is close at hand.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thy words are false!&rsquo; cried Sigeband, &lsquo;for
who that knoweth how my dear son was torn from
me may believe he still doth live? &rsquo;Tis many
years now I have mourned his death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then turning to the Queen, the messengers asked
her whether she would still know the cross she had
given to her son; whereat a great flood of joy swept
over her, and she cried eagerly, &lsquo;Let us hasten to
the shore that I may see the cross!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King ordered horses to be brought at once,
and rode forth with the Queen from the gates of
the castle, followed by a stately train. Hagen
meanwhile had come on shore with the knights and
the maidens, and when he beheld his beloved parents
once again his heart swelled with joy, while tears
overflowed his eyes. Crowds of people had gathered
to gaze upon him, for he had grown to be a mighty
hero. The King made him welcome, saying: &lsquo;If
thou art he whom thou declarest thyself to be, then
shall my declining years be made glad indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As his mother approached, the youth drew the
golden cross from his breast and held it out to her,
whereupon with a cry of joy she clasped him to
her heart and wept aloud for happiness, while his
father, too, embraced him, with streaming eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hagen now interceded for the count, and Sigeband,
who could refuse nothing to his new-found son,
clasped hands with his enemy in token of peace, and
promised to make amends for any wrongs the count
might have received at his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joyously they all took their way back to the
castle. The Queen welcomed the maidens as if they
had been her own daughters, and clothed them in
the costliest apparel. Hagen soon after chose the
maiden from India, Hilda by name, as his wife.
On the death of his parents he mounted the throne
and became one of the mightiest princes that ever
reigned. His wife presented him with a daughter,
also called Hilda, who afterwards became Queen of
our land and whose wrongs we are now going forth
to avenge. God grant her child Gudrun be yet
alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night had fallen as the old knight closed his tale.
The full moon rode high in the heavens and the
pale stars looked down kindly upon the band of
warriors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Welcome Message</span></h2>
<p>One day Gudrun stood with Hildburg
on the shore watching the sun sink like
a fiery ball into the shining sea, when
suddenly something rose above the crimson
surface of the water that looked like a white
swan. But when it came nearer, Gudrun saw that
it was a beautiful mermaid; and as both the damsels
gazed in wonder at this apparition, it spoke to
them and said: &ldquo;If ye seek for comfort, then ask
of me what ye would know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Gudrun asked first of all if her mother yet
lived and if all was well with her.</p>
<p>The mermaid answered: &ldquo;Gladly will I tell thee
what &rsquo;twill rejoice thy heart to hear. Queen Hilda
lives and ever hopes to see thy safe return. To
that end hath she made ready such a mighty fleet
as seldom hath sailed the waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Gudrun asked: &ldquo;How fares it with my
brother Ortwin? and tell me, O gentle spirit, is
Herwig, my betrothed, alive?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="601" />
<p class="caption"><i>Gudrun on the Strand</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>In silvery tones the mermaid replied: &ldquo;Well are
they both, and now upon the sea. Soon shalt
thou have proof that thou art not forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Gudrun&rsquo;s face shone, and tears of joy glistened
in her eyes. &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;these are
joyous tidings thou dost bring me. Yet tell me
further if thou canst&mdash;do Irolt and Morung come
hither also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon shall many a Norman helm be shattered
by their swords!&rdquo; answered the maiden,
and so saying she disappeared beneath the crimson
flood.</p>
<p>Then the maidens lamented that they could
question her no further, and Gudrun said: &ldquo;Come
forth to us once more, sweet messenger!&rdquo; whereat
the water parted and again the mermaid arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask what thou wouldst know!&rdquo; she said, and
Gudrun continued eagerly: &ldquo;Hartmut and Ludwig
are well armed and have many a valiant knight to
aid them, wherefore I would know if Horant too
is with my kin. &rsquo;Twould grieve me much did we
lack his sword in battle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is among the heroes on the fleet,&rdquo; the mermaid
answered; &ldquo;when they shall engage in battle
to deliver thee and avenge the death of the King
and his followers, &rsquo;tis Horant that will bear thy
mother&rsquo;s banner in the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more Gudrun asked: &ldquo;And Frute and
Wate&mdash;are they too with our knights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; replied the mermaid, &ldquo;thou hast no
truer friends than those same heroes. Frute is on
that ship whose helm Count Wate&rsquo;s mighty arm
directs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she was about to vanish, but Gudrun cried
beseechingly: &ldquo;Tell me, I pray thee, when shall
the first messenger from my mother appear to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the mermaid answered as she slowly sank
beneath the waves: &ldquo;To-morrow morn two messengers
will come to thee&mdash;warriors are they both,
on whom thou mayst rely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun and Hildburg were now so full of joy
and hope that they only half completed their allotted
tasks, and they talked of nothing but the
beloved friends they were so soon to see. On
their return in the evening they were received by
the wicked Gerlinda with bitter abuse because they
had accomplished so little work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Hildburg pleaded: &ldquo;Be patient with us, madam,
for indeed we work as much as we are able. Were
it not for the biting winds that blow upon the shore
we could do better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Queen replied harshly: &ldquo;What care I
for the cold winds! See to it ye are at your work
betimes upon the morrow, for there is much to be
made ready for the feast, and if all be not finished
by nightfall, in truth ye shall suffer for it more
dearly than ever did servants of a King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After their scanty meal of bread and water, they
sought the chamber where two hard benches without
pillows of any sort served them as beds; but
little sleep was there for them, so eagerly they
watched for the first glimmer of dawn. At last a
faint ray of light penetrated the chamber, and Hildburg
arose and looked out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what shall we do? Snow
has fallen in the night. If we are forced to wash
to-day in those piercing winds, by sunset they will
surely find us dead upon the shore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun, too, shuddered at the thought, but she
reminded Hildburg it was there they were to see the
messengers, and this gave them courage. Also she
said to her: &ldquo;Go thou to the Queen and beseech
her to give us shoes to wear to-day. If I ask it she
will certainly refuse, so great is her hatred for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>So Hildburg sought the Queen, who still lay in
her luxurious bed, but the maiden dared not awaken
her and returned sadly to her companion. Gerlinda
soon appeared, however, and berated them
roughly for not being already at their work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow has fallen, O Queen,&rdquo; said Hildburg;
&ldquo;give us shoes to wear, we pray thee, else shall we
surely freeze!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gerlinda only laughed, and cried scornfully:
&ldquo;Let your pride keep you warm, forsooth! No
shoes shall you have from me. And beware if
your work be not finished by nightfall! What
would your deaths matter to me, fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weeping bitterly, Gudrun exclaimed: &ldquo;It may
be God&rsquo;s will that I shall one day remind thee of
this!&rdquo; And in their bare feet the poor maidens
made their way through the March snows to the
seashore and began their painful task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Two Knights</span></h2>
<p>Beyond the royal castle the coast was
thickly wooded for a long distance, and
there the fleet from Hegelingen had lain
concealed for two days, having reached
Normandy at last after their long and tedious voyage.
The horses were led ashore to stretch their
stiffened limbs, and all was made ready for the approaching
struggle. Wate charged his men to see
that the fastenings of helm and hauberk were well
secured, adding: &ldquo;If there be any whose shirt
of mail too loosely sits upon him, he may choose
another, for Queen Hilda has provided five hundred
fresh suits of armor and each good knight
may claim one as his due.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heroes then held a council and Ortwin said:
&ldquo;Frute hath seen seven castles from the tree on
yonder hill; but which of them is Ludwig&rsquo;s and
Hartmut&rsquo;s stronghold? We first assail that, and
before the battle we must also learn where Gudrun
and the other maidens abide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Spies must be sent out,&rdquo; declared Frute.</p>
<p>Whereupon Ortwin announced that he would be
a spy and go in quest of what they wished to learn.
All protested against this plan, but the young hero
said firmly, &ldquo;Mine is the task of right, since
Gudrun is my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true she is thy sister, brother Ortwin,&rdquo; said
Herwig, &ldquo;but also is she my betrothed. Therefore
I will go with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This did not please Wate, and finding they were
not to be moved from their purpose, he grew very
wroth. &ldquo;This is but childish folly!&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;and never will I agree to it. &rsquo;Twould be bad
enough were one of our knights to be seized by
Hartmut&rsquo;s people, but how would it fare with you,
did such befall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must shrink from no danger when Gudrun&rsquo;s
rescue is at stake,&rdquo; replied Herwig; &ldquo;nor would
any in all the army be so zealous in her cause as we
ourselves. Wherefore gainsay us not, good Wate,
for thou canst not alter our determination.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Then, summoning the foremost of their comrades,
they charged them to fulfil faithfully the
oaths they had sworn. &ldquo;Mark well my words,
bold warriors!&rdquo; said Ortwin; &ldquo;should we be
captured and held for ransom, sell all your lands and
goods, if need be, to secure our freedom. But if
they slay us, then avenge our death as befitteth true
comrades; and above all, I charge you, spare no
effort to deliver Gudrun and those other unhappy
maidens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this they all pledged themselves and gave the
princes their hands upon the promise, vowing never
to rest till Gudrun was restored to her home. Then
Ortwin and Herwig took leave of their comrades,
stepped into a boat and pushed off, followed by
many an anxious glance. Keeping close to the
shore, they had rowed almost to the nearest castle
when, rounding a wooded point, they beheld two
maidens on the strand. At the sight of the approaching
knights Gudrun was seized with mingled
joy and fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These must be the warriors of whom we were
told!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yet how can I endure the
shame of it, should any messenger from my friends
find me in this wretched plight? Tell me, I pray
thee, dear Hildburg, what I shall do,&mdash;remain
here at my shameful task, or seek refuge in flight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely thou knowest best what is befitting,&rdquo; replied
Hildburg. &ldquo;Choose therefore quickly, and
I will do as thou sayst.&rdquo; And with that, Gudrun
turned and fled.</p>
<p>When the heroes saw the maidens disappearing
they hastily leaped ashore, for they had hoped to
gain some information from them. &ldquo;Why do ye
flee from us, fair maids?&rdquo; they cried; &ldquo;surely we
mean you no harm. Come back! or ye shall
lose all the costly garments that lie here upon the
shore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the maidens paid no heed. Then Herwig
shouted: &ldquo;I charge you in the name of woman&rsquo;s
honor to reply to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the tears started to Gudrun&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;have we ever forgotten aught
that is due to woman&rsquo;s honor? No longer will
I seek to flee!&rdquo; and therewith she returned to the
shore followed by Hildburg. The knights gazed
at them in astonishment; for in spite of their long
and arduous labors they still retained their proud
and lofty bearing, though so scantily clad that
they shivered in the chill March snow falling
about them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; said Ortwin. &ldquo;May God chastise
any that would deal evilly by you! But methinks
ye are more fit to wear crowns than thus to toil
beside the shore. Hath your master other washer-maidens
so fair as ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In yonder castle are many maidens more
beautiful than we,&rdquo; replied Gudrun. &ldquo;Yet, I pray
thee, sir, permit us to return to our task, for
should our mistress see us idle it would fare ill
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Ortwin offered them four golden rings,
saying: &ldquo;Nay, be not angry at our words, but
take these rings. They shall be yours if ye will
but answer truthfully the questions we would
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun shook her head. &ldquo;We may take no
gifts from ye, fair sirs,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;yet put
your questions quickly, for we must not stay. If it
were known at the castle that we had talked with
you, we should pay dearly for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First tell us, then,&rdquo; said Herwig, &ldquo;to whom
may all these rich lands and castles belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;King Ludwig is lord of this land, and in
yonder castle holds his court,&rdquo; replied Gudrun.</p>
<p>Herwig asked if Hartmut was then at home, and
Gudrun answered: &ldquo;He is even now within the
castle, and with him full four thousand of his
knights.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The maidens would fain have departed, yet they
were loath to leave the strangers, whose speech
reminded them so much of home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would learn further,&rdquo; said Ortwin, &ldquo;wherefore
Hartmut hath so many knights assembled at
the castle. Is he perchance at feud with some
neighboring country and seeking to guard himself
against attack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that I know naught,&rdquo; replied Gudrun; but
after a pause she added: &ldquo;Yet there is one, a far
distant land whose power Hartmut well might fear.
It is called Hegelingen.&rdquo; As the name of the
fatherland passed her lips tears streamed down
the maiden&rsquo;s cheeks and she turned away to hide
them.</p>
<p>When the heroes saw how the damsels shook
with cold they hastily offered their cloaks, but
Gudrun refused them, saying: &ldquo;May God reward
your kindness, gentle sirs, but none shall ever see
me in man&rsquo;s attire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Herwig looked more closely at her,
and a sigh escaped him as he seemed to see a likeness
to the fair betrothed whom he supposed to
have been forced to become Hartmut&rsquo;s wife, little
thinking that she now stood before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Again Ortwin questioned her: &ldquo;Were not some
noble damsels once brought hither from a distant
land? One of them was called Gudrun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, &rsquo;tis true!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Well do
I know her whom thou namest. She came as
Hartmut&rsquo;s captive, and much hath the poor maid
been forced to bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the heroes cried with one voice: &ldquo;Tell
us quickly, damsel, where we may find her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If indeed it be she ye seek, then never shall
ye find her more on earth,&rdquo; said Gudrun. &ldquo;Of
grief and suffering is she dead and lieth deep beneath
the flowery sod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herwig covered his eyes with his hand, while
Ortwin turned away and leaned upon his sword,
shaking his head sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Then Gudrun cried: &ldquo;Why are ye so moved
by this news, sir knights? Your breasts heave as
they would burst your mail asunder! &rsquo;Twould
almost seem that ye were kin to that poor maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herwig could no longer contain his grief, but
wrung his hands and cried aloud: &ldquo;Alas, noble
damsels, she was more than life to me! My bride,
betrothed to me by solemn vows when Hartmut
treacherously did steal her from her home!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thy words are false!&rdquo; cried Gudrun. &ldquo;Thou
art not Herwig! He would long since have sought
to deliver her; or were she no more, then at the
least her unhappy women, one of whom am I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, by my faith, &rsquo;tis truth I speak!&rdquo; said
Herwig. &ldquo;If thou indeed art one of Gudrun&rsquo;s
maidens, then wilt thou know this ring upon my
finger, for &rsquo;twas a gift from her, who once did
wear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Gudrun&rsquo;s eyes shone like stars and her
cheeks flushed. &ldquo;Well do I know both gold and
jewel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for it was I that wore the ring!&rdquo;
And raising her own hand, she added: &ldquo;Perchance
thou knowst this also; &rsquo;twas Herwig placed it on
my finger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now at last brother and sister, bridegroom and
bride, knew one another and wept together in
mingled joy and sorrow. Still supposing her to be
Hartmut&rsquo;s wife, Ortwin at length asked Gudrun
how she, a Queen, chanced to be in such wretched
plight and forced to perform such menial tasks.</p>
<p>Weeping she answered: &ldquo;How couldst thou
think, my brother, that I would wed King Hartmut?
Ever have I remained true to my plighted
troth and therefore am I forced to bear much evil.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well indeed have we succeeded in our task!&rdquo;
cried Herwig. &ldquo;Come let us hasten to the boat
and thy maiden with thee. Our fleet is close at
hand and we will guide thee thither. Now of a
truth are all thy sorrows ended!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may not be,&rdquo; replied Ortwin, &ldquo;dear as my
sister is to me. Aye, had I an hundred sisters like
to Gudrun I would lose them every one, rather than
steal them thus away like any thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet bethink thee how Gudrun&rsquo;s danger will increase
when our presence here is known,&rdquo; remonstrated
Herwig. &ldquo;Perchance we shall never find
her then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, Herwig!&rdquo; answered Ortwin.
&ldquo;Though my sister be buried in their deepest
dungeon&mdash;thou still shalt see her on the morrow.
Yet even should it be otherwise, I would be
hacked to pieces with her on this spot ere she
should with my consent be taken away in secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun said reproachfully: &ldquo;What evil have I
done to thee, my brother, that thou wouldst leave
me longer in servitude? Didst thou know what I
am forced to bear, thou wouldst take me hence this
very hour!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think not, dear sister,&rdquo; replied Ortwin, &ldquo;that
I fail in love for thee. But to do thus, believe me,
were no knightly deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Herwig agreed with Ortwin in this,
and they accordingly took leave of the maidens and
returned to their boat. Gudrun wept bitterly,
crying: &ldquo;Alas! are my troubles never to cease?
For years have I waited and longed for this, only
to be once more forsaken when I scarce have
looked upon your faces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but for a brief space that we leave thee,
dearest maid,&rdquo; cried Herwig from the boat, &ldquo;that
we may bear thee homeward in all honor. To-morrow
morn at sunrise we shall be before the
castle with a host. Be of good cheer and let no
one know that thou hast seen us. God will be our
aid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, they seized their oars, and soon the
boat was lost to sight behind the bend in the
shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Danger and Stratagem</span></h2>
<p>Now it chanced that Heregart, the damsel
who was wedded to Hartmut&rsquo;s cup-bearer,
had spied the two knights with Gudrun
and Hildburg on the shore, and supposing
them to be fishermen, she told the Queen how
Gudrun had kissed and embraced them. Hastening
to the window, Gerlinda saw the maidens standing
idle and seeming by their motions to be talking
eagerly together. So indeed they were, for they
could think of nothing but their happiness and the
good fortune that was in store for them the next
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two great and noble Kings have this day held
me in their arms,&rdquo; said Gudrun, &ldquo;and no longer
will I degrade myself with these shameful tasks
Gerlinda hath imposed on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hildburg replied: &ldquo;Methinks &rsquo;twere better
we did finish what was given us, for that wicked
wretch will make us suffer yet more cruelly if she
find it left undone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, let come what will,&rdquo; cried Gudrun,
proudly, &ldquo;for me, I care not!&rdquo; and therewith she
flung all the garments into the sea. For a time
they floated on the surface, then sank, and were
seen no more. By this time it was growing dark,
and the maidens took their way back to the castle,
where the Queen met them with angry abuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore tarriest thou so late?&rdquo; she cried to
Gudrun. &ldquo;The love of mighty Kings thou dost
despise forsooth, yet thou stoopest to bandy words,
aye, and kisses, too, with low knaves upon the shore.
Deny it not, for Heregart with her own eyes hath
seen it! Methinks thy boasted pride should keep
thee from such deeds as this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun raised her head, and her cheeks flamed,
as she retorted: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis shameful falsehood thou dost
speak! Never have I held speech with any man in
all this land save he were of my friends or kindred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Gerlinda, choking with rage, &ldquo;thou
darest to give me the lie! Dearly shalt thou
atone for this, thou spiteful jade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take heed how thou dost do me further
wrong!&rdquo; said Gudrun. &ldquo;Of nobler blood am
I than thou; and thy whole house and thou
may one day have to reckon for your sins!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Suddenly Gerlinda discovered the empty baskets
and asked where the garments were. &ldquo;At
the bottom of the sea!&rdquo; replied Gudrun, &ldquo;where
they may remain, for aught of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now shall it fare ill with you for this!&rdquo;
shrieked the Queen, and trembling with passion
she ordered thorns to be brought with which to
scourge Gudrun&rsquo;s back, and bade two of her retainers
bind the maiden to a post with hempen
cords. At this a great weeping and wailing arose
among the women; but Gudrun in her extremity
resorted to an artifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gerlinda,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thou hast been greatly
deceived. Yet bethink thee&mdash;how can it be that
I should ever wear the crown of Normandy, if I
have once been bound and scourged by knaves
here in thy land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In speechless astonishment the Queen gazed at
Gudrun as if she had not heard her words aright.
But the maiden continued: &ldquo;It is even as I say.
If it be still his wish I will consent to wed thy son
and be Queen of Normandy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Forthwith some knights who heard these words
hastened to Hartmut with the news, hoping for a
reward. That hero was seated in his chamber with
his comrades, listening to the tale of some aged
warrior&rsquo;s heroic deeds, when the door flew open and
a knight burst in exclaiming: &ldquo;Good news, good
news, most noble King! The lady Gudrun&rsquo;s heart
hath softened, and she consents to be thy wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, surely thou art mad!&rdquo; said Hartmut.
&ldquo;How can it be, when all these years she hath
remained deaf to my entreaties? Yet, by my
faith, an thy words prove true thou shalt have
three castles with all the lands thereto, aye, and
sixty rings of gold moreover, for thy news. Ah,
then indeed would my life be blest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith came a second knight and said: &ldquo;The
Queen desires thy presence, my lord, for Gudrun
agrees to accept thee as her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hartmut sprang up joyfully and hastened
to Gudrun, whom he found still in her dripping
garments. The tears started to her eyes at sight
of him, for although necessity had forced her to
this stratagem, it grieved her sorely that she must
deceive him. He was about to clasp her to his
heart, but she stepped back, saying: &ldquo;Nay, my
lord Hartmut, that may not be as yet. Ill would
it become a mighty King to stoop to a lowly
serving maid as I am now; but when I stand
before thee crowned and clad in royal robes, then
mayst thou embrace me before all thy knights.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble maiden,&rdquo; replied Hartmut, &ldquo;since
thou art now to be my wife, gladly will I do thy
will in all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this be true and I may here indeed command,&rdquo;
said Gudrun, &ldquo;then do I desire a bath
to be prepared at once, and let my damsels be
restored to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy wishes shall be obeyed forthwith,&rdquo; replied
Hartmut, and he ordered the maidens to be summoned
thither from their labors. Soon they appeared,
clad in soiled and ragged garments, their
hair hanging in disorder about their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, O King, the plight of these poor
maids!&rdquo; said Gudrun, pointing to them. &ldquo;Methinks
&rsquo;tis little to thy honor they should meet
with such mistreatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All shall be changed now, I promise thee, fair
maid,&rdquo; replied the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See then that those who have been made to
suffer for me be provided with such apparel as
befits their rank, for all are of noble birth,&rdquo; demanded
Gudrun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>After Hartmut had issued these commands he
left the hall; and the tirewomen, hoping thereby
to win Gudrun&rsquo;s favor, performed their tasks with
such zeal and despatch that soon the maidens blossomed
out fair and beautiful once more in their
costly attire. But before Gudrun they all paled
as do the stars before the sun.</p>
<p>Then Hartmut had rich viands laid before them,
with wine and mead; and sending for his sister
Ortrun, he made known to her that what they
so long had prayed for at last had come to pass.
Ortrun hastened at once to Gudrun and the two
maidens wept in each other&rsquo;s arms. Once more
they sat joyfully side by side, yet each had a different
cause for happiness; Ortrun rejoicing that she
was to have Gudrun as a sister, while Gudrun&rsquo;s
thoughts were of her friends and the deliverance
that was to come to her through them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already had it been agreed,&rdquo; said Ortrun, &ldquo;that
I should wear the crown of the kingdom; for since
thou didst scorn Hartmut, he would always have
remained unwedded. But to thee, dear Gudrun, I
gladly yield both crown and royal honors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Her loving words brought tears to Gudrun&rsquo;s
eyes, and she replied softly: &ldquo;Never hast thou
shown me aught but kindness. May God reward
thee for it! Nor will I forget how oft my sufferings
have caused thee grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning to Hartmut, she said: &ldquo;Do thou
send messengers to all thy friends and summon
them to court without delay. Not till these have
shown themselves loyal to me may I wear the
crown of thy kingdom in peace and safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Hartmut went forthwith and chose an hundred
knights to ride forth with messages that very
night&mdash;much to Gudrun&rsquo;s secret joy, for she knew
these warriors would be far from the battlefield
by the next morning.</p>
<p>Then she begged to be left alone with her damsels
after their long separation, and Gerlinda and
Hartmut yielded willingly to her desire. Ortrun,
too, kissed her friend and departed, while Hartmut
sent cup-bearers and servers, who once more loaded
the tables with food and drink.</p>
<p>One of the maidens cried woefully: &ldquo;My heart is
like to break, for now we shall see home no more,
but ever abide here with those who brought us
hither to our sorrow.&rdquo; And she began to weep as
did all the rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Gudrun dared not speak now of the news which
had brought her such comfort, but her joy was so
great that she laughed aloud. Word of this was
brought to Gerlinda, who told Ludwig of it and
then sought Hartmut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;believe me, some dire
evil threatens us! Gudrun, whose lips have never
smiled in all these years, hath just laughed aloud,
so that the sound of it was heard in the hall without.
Some secret message must have reached her
with good news. Be on thy guard, I say, and see
that thy comrades are well armed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hartmut was too full of joy to harbor any
thought of ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begrudge not her happiness to the maid!&rdquo; was
his reply. &ldquo;Her friends are much too far away
ever to come hither to seek her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After their repast, Gudrun asked the servitors if
beds had been prepared for her and her women;
whereupon, taking lights, they led them to a hall
in which stood thirty beds, with pillows of gayly
colored Arabian stuffs, and decked with coverlets of
silk cunningly interwoven with threads of gold
which gleamed like fire. Gudrun dismissed them,
saying: &ldquo;We would fain seek rest such as has long
been denied us; wherefore depart and leave us to
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>When they were alone, the doors were made fast
and all seated themselves to partake of the rare
wines that had been placed upon the table. Then
Gudrun said in a low voice: &ldquo;At last, dear maidens,
I may make known what cause we have for rejoicing.
All have remained true to me and to the
fatherland save one, Heregart, who will sorely rue
her infidelity, I fear. This very day my brother
Ortwin, and Herwig, my betrothed, came to me
bringing good tidings. To-morrow you yourselves
shall see them before the castle with all their host.
Hearken now and mark my words! She who with
morning&rsquo;s light shall first discover the banners of
our friends and tell me of it will have rich reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the joy of the maidens knew no bounds;
but Gudrun, fearing there were listeners without the
door, bade them repress all expression thereof that
might betray them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Morning</span></h2>
<p>When Ortwin and Herwig returned
from their quest, the other heroes hastened
joyfully to meet them and asked
what news they brought. &ldquo;Quickly
summon all our comrades and then ye shall learn all,&rdquo;
replied Ortwin. When the warriors had gathered
about him in a circle he began: &ldquo;Fain would I
leave unsaid that which I have to tell, good comrades.
I have seen my sister Gudrun and her
companion Hildburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here one of the knights interrupted him, saying:
&ldquo;Make no mock of us, Sir Prince! How
could that have been? Gudrun, if indeed she yet
doth live, would surely be kept safe within the
castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill would it become me to make sport of gallant
knights,&rdquo; replied Ortwin. &ldquo;If you doubt my
words, ask Herwig then, for he did also see her;
yet, alas! &rsquo;twas in such a plight that deeply must
we sorrow for her fate. We found her with
Hildburg, who doth share her lot, as a washer-maiden
on the shore!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>At this the heroes shed tears of grief and rage,
but old Wate shouted: &ldquo;Now, by the mass, this is
no time for tears. Rather let us go forthwith and
dye those garments crimson that Gudrun hath
washed white for Hartmut and his knights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A council was now held to determine the best
plan for attacking the castle both by land and sea.
&ldquo;Let me but have them once within my reach,&rdquo;
said Wate, &ldquo;and I will thank them well for what
they have done to Gudrun! Hearken now to my
counsel. One part of our forces must approach
the castle walls by land before the dawn; this I
myself will lead. The moon shines bright, and ere
&rsquo;tis day we shall have the castle surrounded on
every side, while in the early morning ye shall bring
the rest of our warriors with the fleet to aid us from
the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>This plan was at once agreed upon and all busied
themselves with preparations for departure. Long
before daybreak Wate with his force had completely
surrounded the castle on the landward side. A
wood concealed the horsemen, who stretched themselves
out with their heads upon their shields to
enjoy a brief repose. Wate had enjoined them,
however, to be early astir, and linger not after the
first sign of dawn. At the first sound of his hunting
horn all were to seize their arms, at the second
seek their steeds, and at the third they were to swing
themselves into their saddles and follow the banner
of the Queen, which was to be borne before them.</p>
<p>Herwig, Ortwin, and the other heroes meanwhile
had embarked with their followers and were waiting
for the dawn. Quickly the night hours passed, and
the morning sun rose in splendor from the sea.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">From helm and harness, spear and shield</p>
<p class="t0">Shot forth in dazzling ray&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">A sea of fire which seemed to spring</p>
<p class="t0">From wood and plain and bay,</p>
<p class="t0">And rolling in swift circling course</p>
<p class="t0">About the castle lay.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Gay banners in the morning glow,</p>
<p class="t0">Soon waved on every height;</p>
<p class="t0">In majesty, like giant swans,</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the waters bright,</p>
<p class="t0">Glided the ships with sails outspread&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">In truth a noble sight.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the damsels approached Gudrun&rsquo;s bed, and
cried, &ldquo;Awaken, lady, for our knights are near!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Quickly she sprang up and hastened to the
window; but when she saw the banners fluttering
in the morning breeze and looked down on
the thousands who were joyously pressing on to
battle, she burst into tears at the thought of how
many gallant heroes must fall in death that day.</p>
<p>Suddenly the tower warden raised his mighty
voice. &ldquo;Up&mdash;up! bold knights,&rdquo; he shouted,
&ldquo;up and to arms! Already have the Norman
heroes slept too long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerlinda heard his cry and, springing from her
bed, mounted to the battlements of the castle and
gazed down tremblingly on the host. Then she
hurried down to arouse King Ludwig who as yet
had heard nothing of the alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake! awake! O King,&rdquo; she cried in shrill
tones. &ldquo;Our castle is surrounded by a mighty
army, and dearly shall we have to pay this day for
Gudrun&rsquo;s laughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ludwig bade her be silent, declaring he must
see this army with his own eyes. &ldquo;Yet, come what
will,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am ready to meet it!&rdquo; Then
going to the window and looking down at the
advancing host, he added: &ldquo;Perchance they are
but pilgrims coming hither bent on sale and barter.
Call our son Hartmut, he will know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Hartmut was already awake. He allowed his
men to sleep on, however, and mounted to the battlements
with Ludwig. Meanwhile the sun had lit
the depths below, and when Hartmut beheld the
serried ranks, he said: &ldquo;These are no pilgrims,
surely; they press upon us far too closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the banners, my son,&rdquo; said Ludwig,
&ldquo;mine eyes cannot distinguish the devices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment, Hartmut spoke: &ldquo;I see one
yonder that hath the look of an enemy&rsquo;s; aye, &rsquo;tis
the banner of Karade&mdash;on a brown field waves
a head of ruddy gold. These are no welcome
guests, for ere that standard sinks full many a
stalwart hero will have suffered death. Siegfried,
who leads them, once did also woo Gudrun. The
white one with the golden bars that flies beside it
Wate hath unfurled. Queen Hilda gave it to him.
The aged hero to the right is Frute, brother-in-arms
to Wate. Yonder is Horant, who doth
sing such beauteous lays. Now shall he chant
for us a slumber song when we have slain the
foe and would gain rest from warfare. That
one with the red bars and silver swordpoints
is borne by Ortwin, whose father thou didst
slay upon the Wulpensand; and seest thou yon
banneret of sky blue silk whereon green seaweeds
are emblazoned? That is the device of Herwig,
King of Zealand. He thinks to win back his
bride, poor fool! &rsquo;Tis not his love but death
he shall embrace ere-long, forsooth! Many are
there yet that I do see, but now they make ready
to attack the castle. Let us also arm for the
fray.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>So saying Hartmut descended to the hall where
his knights still slept, and shouted: &ldquo;Awake, ye
heroes! for the foe is at our gates! Up and arm
yourselves. We surely would not show them such
discourtesy as to make them wait for us before
the walls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the news spread through the castle,
and arms were donned with joyous speed. No
sooner did Gerlinda learn that her son was preparing
to go out and meet the foe than she hastened
to him and cried reprovingly: &ldquo;Surely thou
wilt not open the gates and put thyself in peril
without reason? Have we not food for a year
within the castle, so that we may endure a siege?
Let the enemy dash their heads to pieces against
the walls, if they will!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Hartmut was displeased at this, and said: &ldquo;It
is not meet, my mother, for thee to counsel warriors
in such matters. Go teach thy women to embroider
silk with gold and precious stones, which
more befitteth thee. Or send Gudrun to the shore
again to wash thy garments. Thou seest now she
still hath friends to avenge her wrongs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gerlinda only redoubled her entreaties.
&ldquo;Nay&mdash;if thou wilt but be guided by my words,
my son, then shall the foe be brought to naught
before the castle and never win back her we hold
captive here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that Hartmut remained unmoved, she
turned to his knights and cried: &ldquo;Throw not
away your lives so foolishly, but stay within and
fling down stones and beams upon the enemy, or
slay them with bolts from your arblasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hartmut sprang up angrily: &ldquo;Peace, I say! nor
longer seek to counsel those who know better than
thou what were best to do. Shame enough was it
to me that I once did flee before them on the Wulpensand,
and this stain will I to-day wipe out that
my honor may once more shine as bright as gold.
Aye, on the field of battle will I meet them, come
what may, for rather would I there be slain than
live pent up within these walls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Gerlinda dared not gainsay him further, but
turned weeping to the knights: &ldquo;I beseech you,
sirs, to guard my gallant son with all your power.
If you but equal him in valor then surely will
a splendid victory be ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now thou hast spoken well, my mother,&rdquo; said
Hartmut, &ldquo;and all who loyally stand by me to-day
against the foe, shall share, I promise on my
honor, in the spoils.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Hartmut Fights with Ortwin and Horant</span></h2>
<p>Soon the gates of the huge castle were thrown
open, and Hartmut rode forth followed by
three thousand of his knights, leaving the
rest to guard the gates and walls of the
castle. Proudly waved their banners, and helm
and armor glittered in the morning sun. Wate&rsquo;s
hunting-horn sounded for the third time, so mighty
a blast that it almost seemed to shake the walls and
cause great forest trees to tremble. The old hero
bade Horant lead the van and bear Queen Hilda&rsquo;s
banner, while he rode hither and thither disposing
his men in battle array. At a turret window
Gudrun stood, waving a white kerchief.</p>
<p>As the Norman knights appeared, Ortwin asked:
&ldquo;Who may yon hero be who leads the band? His
armor gleams like lightning in the sun, and nobly
doth he bear him. Methinks an emperor would
scarcely ride more proudly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my lord, is Hartmut,&rdquo; replied one of
the knights; &ldquo;he who did steal away thy sister.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! is it so?&rdquo; cried Ortwin; &ldquo;now had the
wicked Gerlinda best aid him to find his way
back in safety to the castle!&rdquo; And he lowered
his spear and plunged the spurs into the flanks
of his snow-white charger so that it bounded high
in the air.</p>
<p>But Hartmut had now discovered Ortwin also,
and made ready to attack him. On they rushed,
and came together with such force that both horses
were overthrown. Out flashed the long swords
from their golden sheaths and played like lightning
about the helms of the two heroes. It was
indeed a mighty combat. But ere-long they were
forced apart by the rush of warriors eager for
the fray, and the conflict became general. On
all sides arose the din of battle. Siegfried was
attacked by a band of Hartmut&rsquo;s knights, but
he laid about him so stoutly that his assailants
soon succumbed to the fury of his blows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Herwig, who was fighting for his bride, dashed
joyously into the battle with colors flying, and
Gudrun soon recognized him by his noble form and
shining armor. Ludwig led his followers against the
Danes who fought under Hilda&rsquo;s banner. Notwithstanding
his years, the old King still had the strength
of a bear, and many a stout helm was shattered by
his sword-strokes as he cut his way deep into
the ranks of the enemy. But Frute with his
Holsteins and Frisians rode against him and slew
many of his followers, while Morung and Irolt
strewed the earth with dead. Once more the tide
of battle brought Ortwin and Hartmut face to face,
and again shield and helm re&euml;choed with their
sounding blows. Each was determined his foe
should not this time escape him, and at last, though
Ortwin fought bravely, Hartmut succeeded in piercing
his helm with a sword-stroke. When the Danes
saw their young chief&rsquo;s armor streaked with blood
they pressed on furiously, but many a good knight
was slain ere they reached the princes and snatched
Ortwin from death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Horant dashed up to learn who had smitten
his dear lord so sorely. Ortwin told him, and
Hartmut, who was not far distant, laughed scornfully;
whereat Horant, giving Hilda&rsquo;s banner into
the hands of a knight, rushed fiercely upon the
Norman King. But many men stood between,
and Horant&rsquo;s sword dealt such slaughter among
them that Hartmut cried: &ldquo;Yon knight hath
wrought enough of evil to us; soon shall he strike
his last blow!&rdquo; and forcing his way to Horant,
he attacked him so fiercely that he was borne to
the ground and would surely have been slain had
not his comrades hastened to his rescue and carried
him from out the press. Such was Hartmut&rsquo;s
strength and valor that many began to doubt
whether they should succeed in taking the castle.</p>
<p>But as soon as the wounds of Ortwin and Horant
had been bound up, those heroes returned to the
battle with unabated courage, while Wate meanwhile
had wrought terrible havoc among the Normans.
Yet fast as they fell, others pressed on to
avenge the death of their brethren, and ever hotter
and fiercer waged the conflict.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ludwig Fights with Herwig</span></h2>
<p>In the tumult, Herwig encountered Ludwig;
and when he beheld the old King, whose blade
dripped with the blood of heroes, he asked:
&ldquo;Who is the aged warrior that so fiercely
wields his reeking sword?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ludwig heard the words and shouted in reply:
&ldquo;My name is Ludwig, and of this land I am the
King. Doth any seek combat with me, let him
step forth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou be he,&rdquo; answered Herwig, &ldquo;then well
hast thou earned my hatred. Upon the Wulpensand
thou didst slay King Hetel and many a comrade
dear. Also didst thou rob me of my fair
betrothed. Wherefore now over thy body will I
win her back to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, &rsquo;twere little need for thee to avow thyself,&rdquo;
said Ludwig, scornfully. &ldquo;But dearly shalt
thou atone for that threat of thine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Therewith the two Kings rushed at each other
amid the shouts of their followers. Herwig in his
fury was like the raging sea; Ludwig, a great gray
rock against which the foaming billows dash in vain.
The struggle had lasted for some moments when
Ludwig&rsquo;s sword descended with such force on the
head of his adversary that Herwig tottered and sank
upon his knee. Again the mighty blade fell and
he would have been slain had not one of his knights
sprung forward and received the blow upon his own
body. The hero paid for his devotion with his life,
but Herwig was borne away by his friends and soon
revived. Looking up at the turret, he cried:
&ldquo;Shame were it to my knighthood that Gudrun
should see me sink upon my knee before yon hoary
chief! Now will I hasten after him to redeem my
honor.&rdquo; And away he dashed, his men following
with flying banners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Hearing these shouts, Ludwig turned about, and
great was his amazement to behold the young hero
whom he had supposed slain. Once more they
fought till their shields grew hot from the shower
of blows, but now as Ludwig flung his sword aloft
to deal the death-stroke to his royal foe, Herwig
thrust his own blade deep into the old King&rsquo;s breast.
Down he fell, and again Herwig smote; whereupon
the head of the fierce Norman monarch rolled in
the sand, staining it crimson.</p>
<p>This was the death signal for Ludwig&rsquo;s band.
Like a hurricane tearing its way through the forest,
on swept Herwig&rsquo;s knights against the foe, and
few indeed were those who survived that terrible
onslaught.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Hartmut Fights with Wate</span></h2>
<p>When the warden on the tower made
known the fall of King Ludwig, loud
shrieks and cries of woe arose within
the castle. These Hartmut heard, and
asking their cause, was told his father had been slain.
Then looking about him and seeing how they were
beset on all sides, he said to his followers: &ldquo;Honor
enough have we won to-day. Let us withdraw into
the castle and await a more favorable opportunity
for a fresh attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His knights followed him gladly, for they were
weary with much strife; but when they sought to
turn back they found the way was barred. Wate
with his men was already fighting before the great
gates. Beams and stones were being flung upon
them from the walls, and bolts fell thick as hailstones
from the clouds, but Wate heeded them
not; his thoughts were bent only upon victory.
Between him and the Normans the dead lay piled
by hundreds, and Hartmut said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;By my faith, &rsquo;tis a mighty foe we have to deal
with, and well are they wreaking vengeance for
their ancient wrongs. If we would reach the gates
once more, we must encounter heavy odds, for look!
the enemy is there before us on every hand. Yonder
wave Siegfried&rsquo;s colors, yet our warriors press
him hard. At the other gate, &rsquo;tis plain by the
swordpoints on his banner that Ortwin fights, and
many shall fall ere he sheathes his sword. On that
side is Herwig with his followers. None can deny
&rsquo;tis in true knightly fashion he doth battle for his
bride. In truth, we have tarried too long on the
field, and I know not which way to turn. Long
will they wait for us within the castle, much I fear,
for neither by craft nor yet by secret passage may
we pass its walls. Naught remains to us save to
dismount and cleave a way for ourselves with our
swords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly they all sprang from their horses,
which they turned loose, and therewith began their
perilous attempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Hartmut sought out Wate, thinking if he could
but slay that mighty champion they might succeed
in gaining entrance to the castle. No sooner did
Wate see Hartmut approaching than he sprang to
meet him. High in the air rose the dust from the
feet of the heroes, and they smote one another so
fiercely that the clang of sword-strokes on shield
and helm was like the sound of hammers in a
forge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Gudrun and Ortrun</span></h2>
<p>Hartmut and Wate were fighting close
beneath the walls of the castle, and
Hartmut could hear his mother making
promises of rich reward to any who
would slay Gudrun and her women. One base
wretch, tempted by her offers, burst into the hall
upon the maidens, who fled shrieking to the windows;
whereupon Hartmut, divining what had
happened, lowered his sword and stepped back a
pace. Seeing their danger, and also how his sister
Ortrun in the fury of despair had forced the
murderer to the balcony, he shouted in thundering
tones: &ldquo;Vile miscreant! what dost thou there amid
the maidens? Touch not a hair of their heads, or,
by my faith, thou shalt pay dearly for it, thou and
all thy kin!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>The terrified murderer slunk away, and once
more the fight went on. But now both Danes and
Normans joined in the strife, and the two heroes
were forced asunder in spite of all their efforts.
When Ortrun from the window saw how fast her
brother&rsquo;s followers were falling, she hastened to
Gudrun and sank at her feet, wringing her hands
and crying: &ldquo;Have mercy, I pray thee, noble
princess! Bethink thee how thou didst suffer when
they slew thy father, and to-day hath mine fallen
by the swords of thy friends. Our bravest knights
are slaughtered, and even now my brother Hartmut
is in peril of his life before Count Wate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun embraced the kneeling maiden and said
kindly: &ldquo;Never hast thou done me wrong, and
gladly would I aid thee in thy need. But how may
I part them? Were I a knight and could bear
arms, then would I hasten down and save thy
brother. But I will do what I can.&rdquo; Going to
the window she waved her white kerchief. Well
for Hartmut was it that Herwig chanced to be so
close at hand, for when he saw Gudrun&rsquo;s signal, he
sprang to the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou dost love me, noble Herwig, then save
King Hartmut from Count Wate&rsquo;s fury!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly will I serve thee, dearest maid,&rdquo; replied
Herwig, and turning to his knights, he shouted:
&ldquo;On with our banner to Count Wate&rsquo;s side, my
comrades!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>But it was not easy to reach Wate through the
press, and Herwig cried to him from afar, &ldquo;Gudrun
beseeches thee, brave Wate, to forbear thy strife.
She offers peace to Hartmut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But filled with the fury of battle, Wate answered:
&ldquo;Am I to be led by women&rsquo;s words, forsooth?
Nay, that were shame! Never will I spare the foe
till Hartmut hath atoned for his misdeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as Herwig sprang forward to part the combatants
the infuriated champion dealt him a blow
that stretched him on the earth. But therewith
Herwig&rsquo;s men pressed hotly on and Hartmut and
Wate were forced apart. Hartmut and a great
number of his knights were made prisoners,
disarmed, and taken to the ships.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Retribution</span></h2>
<p>A general assault was now begun on the
castle. The knights whom Hartmut
had left behind defended it bravely, sending
down showers of bolts and flinging
huge beams and stones upon the besiegers, but
Wate was not to be driven back. With their
battle-axes his men hewed the massive bolts from
the walls, and the gates at last fell crashing inward.
At the same time Horant with the Queen&rsquo;s banner
forced the walls in another place and Ortwin
had also gained them by means of a siege ladder.
The conflict soon spread to the courtyard and
thence to the halls and passages, till the whole
castle was filled with the din of battle. Chests
and presses were broken open in the search for
the treasures Ludwig had once carried off from
Hegelingen, and enough gold and silver, silks and
fine linens, were gathered together to fill two ships.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Ortrun took refuge in Gudrun&rsquo;s chamber. &ldquo;Alas!
dear friend,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;thy people are slaying
all they meet within the castle. In pity protect
me, or I too must die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun took her by the hand, saying tenderly:
&ldquo;Never shalt thou lack aid from me, dear Ortrun.
Indeed, from my heart I wish thee peace and
happiness. Remain here with my maidens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon Gerlinda came flying in. Forgetful of
her pride and arrogance she fell on her knees
before Gudrun, crying: &ldquo;Mercy, mercy, most
noble Queen! Save me from Wate and his warriors,
I implore thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun answered sternly: &ldquo;How dost thou ask
me to protect thee? Didst thou ever listen to
my prayers for mercy? Methinks &rsquo;tis little cause
I have to show thee favor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith Wate himself burst into the hall,
blood streaming from his great beard and staining
his armor. Much as Gudrun was attached
to the old hero, it displeased her that he should
force his way into the women&rsquo;s apartments like
a raging wild boar; yet she approached and greeted
him, while the maidens shrank back, terror-stricken.</p>
<p>Wate bowed before her, saying: &ldquo;Tell me who
are these women here with thee?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is my friend Ortrun,&rdquo; replied Gudrun,
&ldquo;good and kind hath she ever been to me, and
with her are her maids. The rest are those poor
damsels who were stolen with me from Hegelingen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Wate was about to approach them to seek for
Gerlinda, she cried: &ldquo;Nay&mdash;look how thou dost
drip with blood! Surely &rsquo;tis not thus that thou
shouldst appear before fair dames!&rdquo; Whereat Wate
turned away angry and went back to his comrades
who were still fighting in the hall.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he departed when the unfaithful
Heregart rushed in with pallid cheeks and streaming
hair, and falling at Gudrun&rsquo;s feet begged for
mercy. But Gudrun said sharply: &ldquo;Get thee from
my sight, thou false one! What troubles didst
thou ever share with me? Rather hast thou added
to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Heregart pleaded so piteously that at last
she said: &ldquo;Conceal thyself then among Ortrun&rsquo;s
damsels, if thou wilt; no longer art thou worthy
of a place with those thou hast so faithlessly
abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Wate meanwhile was searching everywhere for
Queen Gerlinda and presently came once more to
the hall, shouting wrathfully: &ldquo;Lady Gudrun,
deliver up to me that infamous woman who did
force thee to wash her garments, whose vile deeds
have caused thee so much woe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerlinda was hidden behind the maidens, but
Gudrun would not betray her. &ldquo;She is not here,&rdquo;
was her only reply.</p>
<p>This only added to the hero&rsquo;s fury. &ldquo;Then
will I slay every woman here!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;so
that she shall not escape me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Gudrun&rsquo;s women turning pale with
fright drew apart and exposed the fugitive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried, dragging the trembling Queen
forth by the hand, &ldquo;hast thou aught else to be
washed by the daughter of my Queen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith he seized his victim by the hair and
struck off her head. The maidens shrieked aloud
at this sight, but Wate turned to them once more
and said: &ldquo;Now would I fain see her who was
false to you, for she too must die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun was silent, but a glance from her eyes
showed him which was the guilty one. Heregart
prostrated herself before him and besought him to
spare her life, but he cried: &ldquo;Well do I know how
to deal with women. &rsquo;Tis for that I am chamberlain!&rdquo;
And so saying, he swung his sword, and the
head of the unfaithful maiden rolled upon the floor.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Gudrun&rsquo;s Deliverance</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The fighting was now over; and soon Herwig
and Ortwin entered the hall, followed by their comrades.
The two Kings had laid aside their blood-stained
armor, and Gudrun greeted them tenderly,
embracing them with tears of joy. Then she gave
her hand to her companions, saying: &ldquo;Never will I
be unmindful of your devotion, so long as I do
live!&rdquo; And all felt how true were her words.</p>
<p>Wate, whose fury had not yet subsided, wished
to fire the castle, but Frute opposed it, saying:
&ldquo;What, then, would the women do for shelter till
the time of our return? Moreover, the castle doth
afford us safe and ample lodgment. But let us
make way with the dead who lie about the halls
and passages, and cleanse the walls from blood,
that our dear lady&rsquo;s eyes be not offended with
the sight thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the bodies were all borne to the shore and,
with their armor, cast into the sea. Hartmut was
taken to the ships in chains. Gudrun had saved
his life, but she had not been able to obtain further
concession from her brother and betrothed.
Ortrun, however, was allowed to remain with her.
Some of the knights with their followers went
farther into the kingdom and stormed twenty-six
castles, returning to Gudrun laden with treasure
and bringing many captives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>After a joyous meeting, Ortwin cried: &ldquo;Well
hath our journey ended. Beyond our dearest
hopes have we succeeded; and never will I forget,
my gallant comrades, how loyally you have striven
in our cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time passes,&rdquo; said Wate, &ldquo;let us hasten to
restore Queen Hilda&rsquo;s daughter to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preparations for departure were soon made.
The booty was placed on the ships, and all hearts
beat high with joy at the thought of home. Ortrun
followed Gudrun, weeping bitterly, but Hartmut
was taken on another vessel with five hundred of
his knights. He offered to pledge his life in token
of loyalty if they would leave him in the land of his
fathers. But Wate answered: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis thyself we
would have. In truth, I know not why Ortwin
bears with him to his own land one who even yet
would gladly have his life; yet so it is. Were it
for me to say, forsooth, thou shouldst have speedy
deliverance from all thy troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Home Coming</span></h2>
<p>For a whole year Queen Hilda heard no
news from the fleet that had sailed away
to rescue Gudrun. Each day she ascended
the battlements of her castle Matalan to
watch for some sign of the returning ships. One
bright May morning, when the green meadows were
gay with flowers and the sea was as blue as the sky
above it, as she stood thus gazing out over the
smooth water, suddenly a snow-white sail appeared
on the far horizon,&mdash;then another, and yet another,
till a whole fleet came into view. Hastily descending
from the tower, she betook herself with her
women to the shore, which was soon thronged with
eager men and women and children, and joyous
shouts arose as they recognized the devices on
the sails. Nearer and nearer came the ships.
Brightly shone the sun on helm and armor;
banners fluttered in the breeze; drums, trumpets,
flutes, and cymbals made exultant music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Wate&rsquo;s ship was first to reach the land, and
the hero sprang ashore, Irolt and Frute following.
Reverently they approached and bowed before
the Queen, who greeted them and asked for
her children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God hath aided thee,&rdquo; said Wate. &ldquo;On yonder
ship that now doth approach the shore are Gudrun
and Ortwin; also Herwig, thy daughter&rsquo;s brave
betrothed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen raised her hands to Heaven,
tears of joy streaming down her cheeks as her
dear ones stepped once more upon their native
shore, followed by all the knights and maidens.
Ortwin and Herwig placed Gudrun in her mother&rsquo;s
arms, who clasped her child to her as if she could
never let her go. So great was the joy of both at
this reunion that even stern warriors were forced
to shed tears at the sight thereof. After Hilda
had exchanged greetings with her son and Herwig,
Gudrun led forth a tall noble damsel from the
group of women. &ldquo;Take her also to thy heart,
my mother,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;for a good friend hath
she been to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;I embrace no damsel
who is unknown to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>But Gudrun whispered: &ldquo;Thou must greet her,
mother. &rsquo;Tis King Ludwig&rsquo;s orphan child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; cried Hilda, sharply. &ldquo;She the daughter
of the Norman King? Oh, what evil hath been
dealt me by her house!&rdquo; And turning angrily to
Ortrun, who stood silent before her, she pointed
to the site of the castle, which still lay in ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the work of thy kin!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yet
there are still dungeons beneath yon pile that shall
well serve for thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun burst into tears at this; but Ortwin said
reprovingly: &ldquo;Nay, dear mother, thou shouldst not
speak thus to Ortrun. She meriteth not such anger
in her grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Gudrun added: &ldquo;Truly, had it not been
for her, I never again should have held thee in
my arms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hilda&rsquo;s wrath melted, and giving her hand
to Ortrun, she kissed her, saying: &ldquo;If this be
true, thy kindness shall meet with rich reward
from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Gudrun led Hildburg to her mother.
&ldquo;Thou must thank this maiden also,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;for she hath been a loyal friend to me and shared
in all my troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, my child,&rdquo; replied the Queen, &ldquo;she
shall not lack the reward of the faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all the other heroes had been welcomed, she
led the way back to the castle, where a sumptuous
repast was prepared. Hartmut was left to languish
in his chains, however, and Gudrun bethought her
how she might bring all to a happy issue, for she
greatly desired that a lasting peace should be established
between the two countries. Accordingly, the
next day, after all in the castle had risen from the
board, she said to Ortwin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearken, dear brother, to the counsel I would
give thee, for great advantage shalt thou reap thereby.
I would have thee take Ludwig&rsquo;s daughter Ortrun
as thy wife. Truly never wilt thou find a truer
heart on earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, most good and noble she doth seem to
me,&rdquo; replied Ortwin, &ldquo;but we have slain her father
and her mother; methinks at my side she would
know but little joy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, let thy love teach her to forget her sorrows,&rdquo;
cried Gudrun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>When Ortwin had agreed to her plan, she sent
for Herwig and told him what was purposed; whereat
he was greatly pleased, and said: &ldquo;Aye, let us make
it our care that there shall evermore be peace betwixt
the Normans and ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Gudrun went to the Queen and besought
Hartmut&rsquo;s freedom. Hilda at first refused to grant
it, but Gudrun pleaded with her mother, till at last
she agreed that he should have his liberty so that he
remained unarmed. Soon Hartmut entered the
hall, bearing himself with his wonted pride and with
undaunted courage, though he knew not whether
life or death was to be his portion. But every one
who saw him admired the brave hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me speak with him apart,&rdquo; said Gudrun;
and leading him into the embrasure of a window she
began: &ldquo;If thou wilt follow the counsel I would
give thee, noble Hartmut, &rsquo;twill make an end of all
thy troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well do I know thy virtue, fairest princess,&rdquo; replied
Hartmut, &ldquo;and that thou wouldst counsel
naught but what is right or in accordance with my
honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then help us to establish peace between our
houses for all time,&rdquo; continued Gudrun. &ldquo;My
brother Ortwin will wed Ortrun, and do thou take
the Lady Hildburg for thy Queen. No nobler
maid is there in all the land; and if thou dost make
her thy wife, she will be ever true and loyal to thee,
even as she was to me in my hours of sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; replied Hartmut; &ldquo;if thou seest fit
that thy brother should take my sister as his wife,
then will I wed the noble Lady Hildburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overjoyed, Gudrun hastened to make the good
news known to Hildburg and Ortrun, whose hearts
she already knew were well disposed to the heroes.
In the presence of Queen Hilda and all the court
the two happy pairs plighted their troth, and there
was great rejoicing among the knights. Even old
Wate laid aside his enmity and gave his hand to
Hartmut and Ortrun.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter the nuptials were celebrated and
peace was sealed between the two countries by
solemn oaths. The reconciliation thus brought
about by Gudrun proved of lasting benefit to the
people. Her name was always spoken by them
with reverence. Her courage and constancy and
virtues were extolled by them, and in after days her
fame was as radiant as the stars in the heavens.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
